A long time ago, it was tough to listen to music. If you didn’t go to a concert hall, you could rely maybe on a scratchy record, and of course those fortunate to play an instrument could experience some music at any time. However, it would be difficult, if not impossible to find a professional, potentially life-changing performance of music without leaving your home. 

Today with Spotify and Youtube as well as the rapid advancement of audio technology, this is no longer the case. I personally own speakers, earphones and a pair of headphones for use at home. Together these maybe cost me around $400. This is definitely an expensive investment, but it is one-time (or they would be if I didn’t keep losing my earphones!) and let me experience the best music of any decade in high quality for “free”. I can pick and choose the concert hall, orchestra, and conductor; the list truly goes on and on. Almost every great concert of the past has been recorded, some of them even touched up for a better listening experience. The remastered versions of Maria Callas singing several popular operas are my favourite example of this. Available on Spotify, these performances from the 70s are brought into my life with almost perfect audio quality, with all the annoying noise of the audience edited out.

Often when I go to a concert hall, the acoustic experience is frankly worse than it is when I’m enjoying music in the silence of my own home. Naturally, most of the productions in Singapore cannot compare to the Vienna Philharmonic, so the standard of playing isn’t there either. Why then, would I pay good money to watch a concert where the audience might have noisy children, and might clap during the most precious silence after the third movement of the Brahms Third Symphony? 

Although there is something special about seeing an orchestra live and hearing the music come directly from the instruments into your ears, this is only possible in the best seats in a fantastic hall. This is once again without accounting for the almost guaranteed noise of a rowdy audience. Maybe there’s another reason we go to concerts. What about the social experience? It is fun to go to a concert with my friends, especially when they are musicians, it gives us something to talk about. Indeed, at the concert I went to today I saw some familiar faces that I will probably never see again except in concert halls. However, when you are finally in the hall, there isn’t much socialising to be done! We should keep deathly quiet if we have any respect for the music, which admittedly I don’t do all the time. There’s always the urge to ask my friend where to go for drinks after, or to point out how one of the oboists is out of tune. If musicians can’t keep perfectly silent, how can we expect those with less knowledge to maintain an unnatural silence throughout two hours? 

Today I went to a concert that truly highlighted these problems. It was a concert featuring the world-famous Seong Jin Cho at the Marina Bay Sands hall. This hall is a nightmare, let me just say that if anyone is considering a musical concert there, forget about it (might as well lose the money in the casino!). To make matters worse, a lot of the orchestral instruments were microphoned, which is        inappropriate for a classical ensemble. The millions of harmonics in the instruments cannot be translated through the microphone, which leads to a lack of resonance and causes certain instruments to overpower others. It didn’t help that many of the instrumentalists appeared to be sleeping on the job; either that or the microphones were eating up their sound. Either way, the opening overture had almost no emotions or colour in it, and the violins especially seemed to drone on and on. The warmth of the violin’s tone was completely eaten up by the microphones, so instead of the timbre that mimics almost a human voice, we had something closer to a dying cat. 

Then we had the highlight of the evening, the first Chopin Piano Concerto played by the brilliant Seong Jin Cho, winner of the International Chopin Competition. He opted not to mic his instrument, and through pure talent managed to maintain some colour in the music. However, to be honest I was bored throughout and fidgeting in my seat. It was simply impossible for him to highlight the best parts of the music, especially with this constant violin drone fighting against him. It didn’t help that the curtain backstage absorbed almost all the sound immediately, giving the piano a timbre closer to a fortepiano. (By the way, it wasn’t a 9-foot grand. I think my own piano is a similar size, or even bigger. It looked like a baby grand to me) It honestly gave me quite a headache.

The above pictures are the easiest way for me to illustrate this point. It is of course Monet’s most famous painting, this impression of a sunrise. Notice how when the colour is taken away, so much of the meaning of the picture is lost, and it becomes hard to discern what is what. We can no longer see the direction of the light, nor the delicate rippling of the water. In fact, the sun appears to be completely gone in the black and white, and it is the subject of the entire painting! This is what it feels like to listen to classical instruments distorted by a bad microphone in a lousy hall. 

Seong Jin is a fantastic artist, and I am sure he was devastated by his inability to express his art through no fault of his own. Imagine how horrified Monet would be to see the black and white painting above. The instrument given to him was like a frayed paintbrush, and the hall dimmed all colours to a plain greyscale. Seong Jin was probably paid a big fat cheque to play, and since the concert sold out the organisers likely turned a tidy profit (it is supposedly a charity concert, but this problem plagues concerts all over Singapore). However, I don’t think any amount of money will be able to soften the disappointment Seong Jin must have felt when he first “heard” the hall. 

Concerts like this will definitely hurt the arts scene in Singapore in the long run. As explained above, interest in physically going to concerts is already waning, so actually taking the effort to see a concert live must be an almost priceless experience.  It is admirable Singapore can attract such brilliant artists; of course Lang Lang is coming soon, as well as Diane Damrau and Janine Jensen, all the top of their fields. (Also all their names alliterate, which I found hilarious.) However, if we keep treating them like this, both the chances of them returning, and <i>audiences</i> returning to see them are diminished.

I was very disappointed by the concert today, and I will think twice about going to see concerts in the future. The price simply does not match the quality, in this case you do not get what you pay for. Last year I went to watch a Beethoven concert, and I was very excited to hear the fourth Beethoven piano concerto, my favourite. Instead what I got was more like a Cough Concerto. However, at the very least that time my experience could have been blamed on the audience, and be considered unlucky. This time however, the fault lies entirely with the organisers and probably Seong Jin’s manager, who are <i>paid</i> to ensure things like this do not happen. This concert was plagued by many problems, it was meant to be held in China but due to political reasons they were forced to come here last-minute instead. This led to the poor hall and a general lack of polish from the orchestra, not at all becoming of the price of the tickets. With classical music concerts already a niche form of recreation, we cannot afford to present anything except the best to an audience. It is idealistic to think that a concert should be cancelled if it is not up to snuff, but if we continue having this mindset of profits over passion, soon nobody will be able to make money from classical concerts anymore.
