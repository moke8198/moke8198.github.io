The bus ride home was long, but it was often the favourite part of her day. She enjoyed the chance to unwind; particularly she loved to observe. Most of her life she had been on the outskirts, removed from even her peers. She had always felt that she saw the world differently to others. She hated to hurry.

She noticed the birds were especially loud today. <i>Concerto for two flutes and clarinet, op.18</i>. She had written that when she had been working as a repetitor for a wind band. It wasn't her proudest work, she felt that the use of woodwinds to mimic birds was a stale idea. It got her a decent commission however, even though the ensemble was terrible. She could live with that.

The bus came. The sound of the ez-link cards against the reader stood out to her. From the back of the bus she would count the people as they came in. Two adults, one child. Three adults, two children. She wondered if it would be possible to write with just two tones. She didn't think she was bold enough to write a piece like that, she had always had a secret desire to see her music performed. Her teacher would have scoffed at that, but she wasn't in school anymore.
 
Two middle-aged women were talking loudly in Chinese two seats in front. Both mezzo-soprano, probably. <i>Rhapsody for piano, pipa and zhongruan, op. 45</i>. It had been hard for her to write her first piece for Chinese instruments. The language had always fascinated her, ever since primary school where she had done well in all her Chinese exams. She didn't speak it at home however, and she felt that despite her understanding of the words she would never quite understand the culture. The reimagined piano trio for these Chinese instruments did not go down well among her peers.

She heard four rapid D naturals and she was home. Her apartment wasn't particularly nice, but she knew what she had signed up for. The chime of the lift always reminded her of the opening of Brahms’ Fourth Symphony. She never had a chance to write a symphony, it was always a challenge that seemed insurmountable. She thought back to her two-tone idea. Maybe with the major or minor third, she could write something….

Suddenly she was on the roof. She didn't remember pressing the wrong button on the lift; besides she had never been up here all her life. She looked around for inspiration, major and minor thirds filled her head. Maybe it was time to step out of her comfort zone.

The view was disappointing, and she wondered if she could have gotten further or done more in a more vibrant city. She turned away to go down, and found herself at the edge somehow. <i>Requiem in two tones, for choir and orchestra, op. 81</i>. The concept was ridiculous to her sensible self, yet seemed so perfect as she was falling. Suddenly a minor second pierced the air, and the idea was complete.

She wakes up, groggy and disoriented. Her phone’s ringing incessantly. <i>That’s not my alarm, right?</i> Her alarm is a tone lower. Or maybe it's two tones higher, she’s not entirely sure.

She looks over at her phone. “Shit,” she mutters under her breath. It's eleven in the morning and her boss is calling. She's late for work, and she missed a meeting. Now the deal is definitely going to fall through. She apologises while getting dressed, and skips breakfast.

She drives to work in silence.
