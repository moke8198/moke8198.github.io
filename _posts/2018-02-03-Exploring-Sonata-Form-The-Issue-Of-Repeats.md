As a student, I’m taught to follow every marking on the score like it’s the word of God. However, there is one marking that all students are happy and even encouraged to ignore; the repeat marks in sonata-form movements and pieces. I have never performed a sonata with repeats in public, and I generally don’t bother with the repeats even when I’m just playing for leisure. This mindset has been beaten into me since I was a child, when the teacher never enforced the repeats in those little Czerny exercises for beginners.

I’ve heard the common claim that it’s pointless to play repeats if we aren’t going to do anything new with the material. Repeats are just an excuse to take up more time in our exams and let us memorise less music. In baroque movements, we are given <s>some</s> a minute amount of of liberty for “improvisation” in our repeats, and we can get away with these come the dreaded recital. However when it comes to classical sonatas, repeats are a big no-no. Clearly no teacher I’ve ever had has trusted that I could make a significant difference without changing any notes or ornamentations.

It is difficult to make a change when repeating the exposition of a sonata, however I think this issue is misunderstood/misrepresented (possibly deliberately) by many teachers especially in Singapore. I think that repeats are integral to the form of these movements, and aren’t an aspect of the music that should be bargained with. <b>The point of a repeat isn’t to express the same idea differently, but to express the same idea in almost exactly the same way, perhaps even <i>identically</i> for the purpose of scale.</b>

Unfortunately, short attention spans and a need for standardised examination rules have led to the situation of “no repeats” many young musicians face. I’m not saying that all students should be made to play every single repeat; however I object to every teacher who says things like this: “Don’t worry, we won’t play these repeats for exam, they aren’t important”. I’m sure we have all heard similar things before, and while the repeats might not be important for an <i>examination</i>, they are important in musical <i>performance</i>. I hope I can present a convincing argument for repeats as we look at some of the greatest works of the classical and romantic eras.

(Some knowledge of sonata form will be needed to understand this, I’m not capable enough to explain the concepts of the form concisely. I’m not Dr Kan…yet.)

<div class="header">Early Sonata-form Movements</div>

Sonata-form was the most beloved structure of the Classical masters, and Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven all used it extensively; featuring it in almost all of their works. While they all tweaked it in their own ways, it is Beethoven who truly revolutionised this form, and we will look at some of his genius later. For now, let’s consider a standard sonata-form movement. I’ve chosen to look at the first movement of Mozart’s Piano Sonata in G, K283. This is my favourite of the 6 early sonatas Mozart wrote for his students. These sonatas are invaluable both as a technical resource for intermediate learners and to study for more experienced musicians.

If we look at the repeat sign, we see the dominant chord followed by a rest:

This naturally leads very nicely back into the opening of the movement, in G:
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/repeat2.png" alt=""> 

The harmony flows easily, but more importantly there are no hiccups in rhythm as well. The upbeat naturally provides the missing third beat from the repeat bar. We can safely say that almost all early sonata form movements work this way; the transition back into the beginning comes very naturally. There is no added material before the repeat that will be changed on the second playing; this was a quirk of the early romantic periods as we will see when we look at the B-flat major sonata of Schubert later.

If we look at the development of this sonata, it continues with an appoggiatura G sharp:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/repeat3.png" alt=""> 
<div class="captions">The development introduces a lot of textural change as well</div>

This little suspended note is for me the most colourful note up to this point, functioning as the Neapolitan of the tonic and forms a tritone from the dominant. Of course, this is early Mozart and it’s not exactly wild, but even in this situation I think this transition from the repeat is a bit more exciting and colourful than what we had in the first place. If we had already heard the repeat, this G sharp would stand out even more as we would be expecting G natural. <b>The development is almost always far more effective when we have heard the exposition twice</b>. The movement into development is like a sudden change in brightness or a quick shift in the weather.

If we look at all the Mozart piano sonatas, and indeed any of his quartets or even symphonies, we often find that the first phrase of the development is something very close to the original themes presented in the exposition. The most common device used is a change of tonality combined with a change of register. In the late F major sonata (K533), Mozart uses this theme in the exposition:

Before changing it to this in the development:
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/repeat5.png" alt=""> 

These moments are more magical when we consider the structure of these movements in their entirety. Tonality is a central concept to the sonata form, and <b>time is needed to establish the initial tonal centre to increase the effect of taking it away</b>. I believe that we are not as closely attached to harmony as we once were 200 years ago, as centuries of more and more dissonant music and rapidly changing tonal centres has desensitized us to the simple beauty of the tonic-dominant relationship. While this has its benefits, it’s a shame that we don’t pay more respect to the ratios in classical sonatas: it’s important that most of the piece should be in its home key, and deviances from this are a <b>big deal</b>.

<div class="header">Composers Know Best</div>

I believe there is intention in every note and direction written down on a piece of music. As a performer I will be the first to try and stretch the meaning of these directions, but I still believe in following them carefully. Claudio Arrau said that “if the composer writes <i>forte</i> and you play <i>piano</i>, then you are wrong.” (Paraphrased, I read this in a book once and I can’t recall the exact quote) I agree with this, and I think that when the composer writes <i>dolce</i> or <i>molto appassionato</i>, then you are freer to discuss what that really means. Some directions just can’t be argued one way or the other, and for me repeats fall in this un-debatable category. A composer can’t suggest a repeat, it’s either there or it isn’t. I don’t think the argument that all composers did it because that was The Way has any merit, as we see these composers break from form all the time. 

When it comes to composers that break the mold, Beethoven stands first among all. Beethoven’s Op. 26 A flat major piano sonata famously has no sonata-form movement, and in the <i>Appassionata</i> he writes a sonata-form movement, but there is no repeat!

<div class="captions">Beethoven uses the same technique of changing the tonality of the main theme in the development</div>

I can’t and won’t make a guess as to why this is, but Beethoven definitely didn’t give up on repeats like we have after this, almost all of his sonata form movements after this still have a repeat in them. Even the notoriously long <i>Hammerklavier</i> has a repeat in its first movement. Clearly, there must have been a reason to omit the repeat in the <i>Appassionata</i>. Therefore, if we don’t respect the repeats in his other sonatas, I’d argue that we must think that there was no reason behind any of his decisions with regards to repeats. For me there is no question that <b>the inclusion and exclusion of repeats was <i>intentional</i></b>.

For another example of this, we can look to one of Schubert’s mature sonatas.

<div class="captions">Section discussed starts at 4:40, but you might as well listen to the whole thing</div>

The B-flat major piano sonata (D960) is a beautiful work, and like the <i>Appassionata</i> it is monumental in scale. This has even led to some international pianists omitting the repeat in its’ first movement, which is an absolute travesty. This is because Schubert clearly wanted this repeat played, and we can easily see this by how he gives us new material to play when it is time for the repeat:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/repeat7.png" alt=""> 
<div class="captions">See how extensive the 1. section is compared to 2.</div>

This wacky little theme comes out of nowhere, and is for me so important in tying the work together. This first movement is shrouded in mystery, as evidenced by the famous deep rumbling trill that features in its opening measures:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/repeat8.png" alt=""> 

Everything about this section before the repeat is mysterious. It’s a highly chromatic fragment, has two different rhythmic textures, muddles the pulse with pauses and lasts an awkward 9 bars! It even reprises the trill from the beginning, further obscuring our sense of tonality and structure. How pianists can leave this out in performances boggles me; for me it is the most interesting section of the entire sonata musically. What a shame that we try so hard to follow a composers intentions, and in the same breath leave out 9 bars of precious music! (On a side note, the things I would give for 9 more bars of his Unfinished Symphony...)

<div class="header">Sonata Form in Symphonies</div>

It’s odd then that when it comes to symphonies, I have never heard the repeats excluded. This brings me to a point that I am reluctant to make, but is undeniably true: <b>musicians are never consistent with their rules</b>. All these ideas that I’ve discussed in the context of piano music has its parallels in symphonic works, and yet in those works the repeats are always played. The so-called cons of playing repeats apply even more to an orchestra than to a pianist. Many of these symphonies are far longer, and being a large ensemble it is nearly impossible to make differences in the repeat. However every conductor will take the repeat and try their best to beat at the same tempo and maintain a similar balance. I have never heard a performance where I could notice a difference between the two playing’s of the exposition that wasn’t a mistake. For those who love good music and therefore can tolerate a song longer than five minutes, below is a recording of one of biggest symphonic movements every composed: the first movement of Mahler’s Sixth Symphony. Can you hear any difference between the two playings of the exposition?

<div class="captions">The fact its 23 minutes long never stopped a conductor from omitting the repeat!</div>

Oddly enough, it’s in these huge symphonies where I think we can most clearly see that the inclusion of these repeats is actually necessary. The repeat of the theme in its home key helps to reinforce the idea that we still have a home to come to even in the midst of all the lavish instrumentation and fragmented motifs. We can also see that Mahler’s use of the repeat is once again <i>intentional</i> as in the monstrous 30 minute first movement of the third symphony, there is no repeat.

Another wonderful piece of music. Post on Mahler is due sometime for sure

<i>Speculation: This movement needs no repeat because of its length, and also its motif is familiar being a quotation of the finale of Brahms’s first symphony.</i>

Why do so many musicians omit the repeats from their performance? For examination, I can accept this practice as the purpose behind an examination isn’t really for the examiners to enjoy themselves listening to your music. However, I think there are more insidious reasons behind the practice of omitting repeats in performance.

There is a certain prejudice against classical music; some think that it is very repetitive and hence boring. I don’t agree with this, although I can see where this point of view comes from. Also, there might be marketing concerns, the more pieces one can fit into a program the more appealing it is. However, I don’t think we should be encouraging this practice of playing without repeats, even as I am often guilty of it. A better appreciation of the music can be formed when it is played as it would have sounded in the composer’s mind, and I think that leaving out the repeats should only be used in very extreme cases when it comes to public performance.

After all, if you don’t play the repeats, aren’t you suggesting the work isn’t good enough for you to want to play one of its main sections twice? I’d hope our performers are more invested in their music than that. Music is a story; let’s try to tell a complete narrative.
