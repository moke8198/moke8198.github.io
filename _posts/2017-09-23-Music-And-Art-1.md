Over the course of history, music has evolved hand in hand with the art. Beyond the obvious comparisons of Debussy and Monet, I think there exists a subtle thread that binds the two professions together.  Cultural and political climates affect both music and art, and can push creative minds in different fields to think in the same direction. After all, music is merely art for the ears. In this first post, I will be looking up till the Classical Period, as there’s a lot to cover.

<div class="header">What was before the Baroque?</div>

For musicians, it can seem like the history of the world only started in the Baroque era, perhaps only truly beginning with J.S Bach. Of course this is not the case, but there is a reason why the Baroque Period sparked such a sudden evolution in the arts. However even before that in the 15th and 16th century, culture as we know it had begun to develop in most major cities in Europe. This was especially so in Italy, which was considered something of a cultural hotspot at the time. A movement known as humanism was born here, which is the idea that gives importance to humans, rather than God. This would have been considered sacrilegious in the dark Middle Ages (5th to 15th century, roughly) but with the gradual yet constant advance of technology, these new ideas were allowed to spread and eventually gained acceptance. The invention of the printing press in 1440 especially accelerated this spread of ideas. Eventually this humanist movement spread throughout Europe, and with it the Renaissance period of art; the first time we wanted to create works that did not glorify God but rather the human spirit.

One of the most famous artists of this time is a certain Leonardo da Vinci. Da Vinci was a polymath, supremely talented in many different fields. What he is most famous for however is his paintings. He was the first known artist to accurately and <i>mathematically</i> nail down the proportions of a human body, with his famous sketch of the Vitruvian Man. This application of mathematics to art was somewhat of a novel idea at the time, and of course mathematics and music are bound together, in the sense of rhythm. These proportions are vital in Renaissance and indeed all music, where without a pulse the music often seems to fall apart and make no sense. Even in the later Romantic and 20th century works, even most <i>rubatos</i>  and tempo markings can be boiled down to mathematical equations, as distasteful as that can seem to most musicians.

Two more da Vinci paintings illustrate (get it?) one of the most defining aspects of the time: the divide between the secular and sacred. During the Middle Ages, the church was essentially the government, and controlled the vast majority of the population through religious doctrine. However, in the Renaissance, the power of the church began to decline thanks to this humanist movement. In fact, I dare say the power of the church has been declining all the way from the Renaissance until our present day.  For the first time, secular works of art were achieving public recognition comparable to their sacred counterparts. Below are the Last Supper and Mona Lisa; one is religious and one is not, yet both are instantly recognisable today.

<div class="captions">The Mona Lisa (1503) is famous for it's realism, an effect achieved partially by the subtle use of shadows. More on this later</div>

This is precisely what allowed some secular music to become popular enough that it still exists today. Although for the most part we only have the droning Gregorian chants from the late Middle Ages, in the Renaissance there is a fair variety of surviving sacred and secular works. Alongside with the familiar motets and vespers, we have the Renaissance tradition of madrigal singing. Madrigals are generally unaccompanied polyphonic singing, with simple harmonies and melodies. They are usually a very manageable length, similar in length to the pop songs today. In fact, the madrigal below appears to be about dancing, but this is actually a <i>very</i> thinly veiled allegory for sex. Really not too different from pop today.

Compare this with the massive Montiverdi Vespers, a large scale religious Renaissance work. It lasts for over an hour, with a choir, soloists, and what would have been considered a huge orchestra at those times. Of course, the subject is completely different as well. There is still a distinction between the sacred and secular worlds here, even as the secular arts take their first steps toward greater things.

<div class="captions">I was going to post a shorter excerpt, but doing so isn't really in the spirit of this kind of music. The different sections are listed in the description.</div>

Looking back to da Vinci’s art, we can see a similar difference in the Mona Lisa and the Last Supper. The Mona Lisa only has one simple subject, while the Last Supper is a far grander depiction of the scene in the Bible. There is a lot more going on in the Last Supper, both in the foreground and background, and in terms of the colour palettes used. Yet, both are today considered monumentally important paintings, and I think it is the same case for the music of the Renaissance. While religious works are larger and can utilise more resources with the backing of the Church, humanist ideas are beginning to take root, which is why we have a mix of both sacred and secular music from the Renaissance. Later we will see how in times to come, religious and secular works can be almost indistinguishable, as in the case of Verdi’s <i>Requiem</i>, or perhaps even a certain Baroque oratorio.

<div class="header">The <s>Bach</s> Baroque Period</div>

The Baroque period is actually not just a descriptor of music, but rather culture as a whole in the 17th to early 18th century. The word Baroque comes from the Portugese barocco, meaning an “imperfect pearl”. This word was actually first used as an insult, as in the Baroque Period the simple styles of the Renaissance (Mona Lisa, or madrigal singing) were pushed aside for more elaborate works. Naturally there were critics who claimed that this new art was overdetailed, or too “noisy” (noisy is a term artists use as well, to describe drawings with too many details such that the overall image isn’t clear). Isn’t it the case that whenever there is change, people complain?

With the Baroque period there were huge changes also in society, with the church losing even more power over the people. This is about a half-century before America’s independence, which is the first time a state truly separated themselves from the church. In Europe, the influence of the church was still strong, but artists were beginning to push the limits of what was considered acceptable under Christian law. This was often a direct reflection of the primal desires of humanity, brewing just hidden beneath the law of the church. One of the most interesting examples is the sculpture the <i>Ecstasy of Saint Teresa</i>, a baroque work of art created by the leading sculptor of the day, Gian Lorenzo Bernini. He is credited with pioneering the Baroque style of sculpture.

<div class="captions">The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa, 1652</div>
From the name of the sculpture, there is a clear sense of religious overtones. However, when actually looking at the sculpture, it is definitely not a traditional depiction of a saint. With the position of the saint and the angel descending upon her, the sculpture is sensual, almost sexual. The way it is positioned in the chapel only enhances this image, with light falling on the angel but shadows obscuring the expression of the saints’ turned face. This mixing of secular fantasies with religion is somewhat of a trend in the Baroque period, as we will see in the drama of the <i>St. Matthews Passion</i>.

Religious works of music are often thought to be sombre, and less dramatic than their operatic counterparts. While I have some problems with this, mainly that the story of the Bible in my opinion <i>is</i> dramatic, this was the view taken by most composers especially in the past. However, from the Romantic period onwards, religious music grew larger and larger in scale, and many composers either through choice or inexperience wrote their Masses and Requiems almost as operas. However, I think this trend began with Bach and his setting of the gospel of Matthew. The opening chorus of the St. Matthew’s Passion is huge, featuring a full double choir; in a way almost Mahlerian in stature. The entire work lasts a whopping three hours, and when compared to the Montiverdi Vespers the music is far wider in emotions and more explicit in its storytelling, as well as deeper in colour. With its decorated arias and even its slightly more free-form recitatives, this piece is very much the epitome of the increased ornamentation and detailing of the Baroque era.

<div class="captions">For me, Richter's interpretation of Bach is neither too slow nor too romantic, it is just right</div>

This is equally reflected in the architecture of the Baroque, probably its most important feature beyond its music (Of course I’m biased, for me music is the most important feature of any time in human history). During this time, the royalty and church favoured massive structures for their buildings. They were filled and composed of many colonnades, domes, and pillars, all heavily ornamented. These constructs were used to imitate the effect of <i>chiaroscuro</i>, a technique of using light and darkness to “trick” the eye. This technique was actually earlier by painters in the Renaissance, who used <i>chiaroscuro</i> to give their drawings a sense of depth and form:  

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/art5.jpg" alt="">  

Architects in the Baroque merely translated these ideas onto a three dimensional space to make their wonderful buildings seem larger, as well as enhance their details. This is precisely the technique previously used by Bernini in his sculpture, and we see Baroque artists learning and developing the ideas of the past.  Bach too developed the large scale writing of the Monteverdi Vespers into an equally big but far more dramatic, colourful composition. One might even say that he has made it more Baroque.

<div class="header">The Age of Enlightenment and Classical Music</div>

The middle to late 18th century and early 19th century brought with it new thinking, with rationality prized before authority. Naturally, this period led to many revolutions, most notably the French and American revolutions as the common people realised that their monarchs were treating them unreasonably and wanted to form a new form of government. This led to the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and the birth of the world’s first democracy.

This period of political change also came with a period of cultural and societal change, as music became more accessible to the public due to increasing standards of living as a direct result of the many scientific advances in this period. This on top of people generally being treated better in general (which could be considered a “rational” step for kings and queens to take if they wanted to avoid their subjects chopping their heads off) led to the middle class having time to learn instruments. Much of the music published in this period is easy to sing and play, with many composers choosing to write for the public. This was generally more profitable than relying on the salaries churches would give them to compose masses and cantatas, as compared to the Baroque period where almost all composers had a 
church behind them.

This also led to the birth of the modern opera, which originally was designed as entertainment for the nobility. Composers would be paid a large commission to write an opera, and it was considered as something only privileged people could enjoy. Mozart especially is known for his operas, which although written for royalty has subject matter that any commoner could enjoy.  Perhaps he predicted the eventual transformation of opera into something for the masses?

The Magic Flute (1791) in particular has special ties to the Age of Enlightenment. To understand this, we need to take a few steps back from the music, and look at one of the most interesting side effects of the sudden increases in technology and philosophical human thinking: the influence of secret societies in the Classical times.

Although today, science may often seem to contradict religion, this was not really the case during the Age of Enlightenment. Then, people tried to reconcile their new way of thinking and increased knowledge <i>with</i> religion, and one of the pseudo-religions that was born from this was Freemasonry. This was a popular secret religion in those days, and many famous artists from the time are alleged to be members of their church, known as the Lodge. There’s not much known about Freemasonry although it still exists today (wouldn’t be much of a secret society if I could Google everything about it), but my best guess from some research is that it is a mostly rational thinking group with an origin in the occult. Although this occult influence is present in their doctrine and rules, they prefer to use cunning and manipulation to control society rather than demonic rituals. This, of course, is very in line with the thinking of the Age of Enlightenment.

Mozart is today considered by most historians to have been a Freemason, and the librettist of the Magic Flute, Emanuel Schikaneder, was most definitely a Freemason. More specifically, the opera covers the Freemason ritual of initiation, the process which a new member must go through to be admitted to the Freemason Lodge. This can obviously be seen through the trials Tamino and Pamino go through to become part of Sarastro’s temple and protect themselves from the evil Queen of the Night. There is also less blatant symbolism here, such as the use of the number three: three chords in the overture, three trials for our heroes, three sisters of the Queen of the Night. This number three is important in many religions for several reasons, and here they represent the Freemason trinity, which is a perversion of the Christian Holy Trinity. The Freemason Trinity comprises of wisdom, strength, and beauty, man-made concepts rather than divine ones.

<div class="captions">The three chords that open this music can be interpreted to represent the Freemason Trinity. It is a key theme used throughout the opera</div>

The subject matter of art also took a different turn in the Age of Enlightenment; thankfully for the most part it doesn’t go into the occult and creepy secret societies. Instead, there is an emphasis placed on somehow reflecting the new ideals of society in art. This can seem somewhat contradictory as rational thinking is often not thought of as artistic, but below we can see the most literal example of a painting of rational thinking, Joseph Wright’s <i>A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery</i>, painted in 1766:

<div class="captions">Manipulating light and shadows is second nature to artists 250 years after Da Vinci!</div>

This is a painting of people learning, which to our eyes might not seem like anything special, perhaps even boring. However, in the Age of Enlightenment this was a big deal, this was exactly the kind of gathering that people in those times were seeking towards, an education for the larger masses. As mentioned, art reflects society, and this is a clear indication of a new period in the history of humanity. You would not have seen paintings like this in the Baroque, where almost all art was focused on fantasy and religion, either portrayals of gods or demons. In the Age of Enlightenment, these fancies are restrained, in favour of rationality and reason.

The next period in our history goes almost directly against the Age of Enlightenment, it instead prioritises human emotions and the glorification of the past, choosing almost entirely to ignore the Classical era. Next time (hopefully in a couple of weeks) I will look at Romanticism, and the trends and parallels in music and art until the present day.
