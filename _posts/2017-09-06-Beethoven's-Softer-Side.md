When people think of Beethoven, most of them imagine his Heroic music, large in scale and grand. They imagine him fighting against the world, cursing it for his deafness. The more perceptive might say that his music is also a statement of hope, that while life might be tragic there is always light at the end of the tunnel. The Ninth Symphony is a good example of this; it is in the stormy key of D minor, but there is hope in the final Ode to Joy. Similarly, the Fifth Symphony is known for its fate motif, and with it the theme of death. Yet it too ends in a triumphant finale in some 50 or so bars of C major.

However, I think there is another aspect of Beethoven that is not as well known, but still shows itself in many of his works. This is his more introverted side, his reflective music. He was known to be a rather grumpy man, and life did not treat him fairly with his deafness. Thankfully, even while struggling with his illness, he still managed to compose some delightful music which somehow lacks the death and despair of his more famous works. There is also his romantic side, not too far from the almost feminine writing of Robert Schumann. In his life, there was a mysterious woman referred to as his “immortal beloved”, the addressee of several unsent love letters. I think that these themes of love are most explored in the Eighth Symphony, referred to by Beethoven as his “little symphony in F”.  Here I will look at the other symphony in F, the Sixth Symphony, or the Pastoral Symphony.

<div class="header">A Sense of Time</div>

Beethoven was born in 1770, and began to lose his hearing towards the end of the 18th century. Just after this in 1804, Beethoven finished his Third Symphony (Eroica), in my mind one of the most important works of music ever to be conceived. This begins the so-called Heroic Period of his life, when Beethoven struggled with his deteriorating hearing. Of course, the Eroica has a funeral march as its second movement, and it is quintessential Beethoven with its fusion of form and emotion. I don’t think the Eroica has the despair associated with Beethoven, but it definitely has the grandeur of his Heroic works.

Fast forward a few years to 1807 when the 23rd Piano Sonata is published, more commonly known as the Appassionata. For me, this piece highlights Beethoven’s struggle with his deafness the most. The first and third movements are full of darkness, the last movement especially with its liberal use of diminished sevenths. The final coda is pitch black, as the dominant and tonic are rung like bells of death as the pianist rushes to a F minor close. The first movement also introduces the fate motif, later used in the Fifth Symphony. However, the second movement of this sonata is the kind of introverted writing I am talking about, in the warm key of D flat major. It is a theme and variations, and is the perfect picture of the eye of a storm, in between the two F minor movements. The theme is tranquil and simple, and is gradually built up over the course of five variations, with the last somehow a summary of all we have heard so far (keep this in mind!). However, this tranquil second movements goes <i>attacca</i> (without a break) into the third with crashing, march-like diminished sevenths, as if Beethoven had given up any hope of being able to hear properly again.

A year later there is a concert, known for the premiere of the popular Fifth Symphony. The Fifth as previously mentioned expands on this fate motif, especially in the third movement where the rhythm for me is used most effectively. In this movement, I can really hear the devil’s footsteps and his knock on the door, ready to tell the unfortunate occupants that their time is up. However, in an inversion of the Appassionata, this dark movement goes <i>attacca</i> into the final jubilant movement. These three works are some of the most famous of Beethoven’s output in his Heroic Period. The Eroica has the grandeur, The Appassionata has death, and the Fifth Symphony has hope. They are all large scale, and their creativity is immediately apparent; they sound nothing like the works of Haydn or Mozart. 

At this concert, another symphony is played: the Sixth Symphony, otherwise known as the Pastoral. In this sister symphony to the Fifth, we see the lesser known side of Beethoven. It is a work of childlike magic, smaller in scale but full of surprises, as well as writing that precedes the style of his later works. The Pastoral is to me is as revolutionary the Eroica, and is sadly underappreciated today.

<div class="header">Programmatic music</div>

In 1808 when this concert was held, instrumental music had been popular for almost half a century. However, when it came to storytelling, opera and oratorios were the choice for most composers. After all, it is easiest to tell a story when there are words! Beethoven, ever a revolutionary, tried to paint a picture without words in the Pastoral. This was an inspiration for many works of programmatic music, or music that tells a story. The programmatic works of Schumann, Liszt and Rachmaninoff owe a lot to this symphony, and even living composers cannot run from the Pastoral when trying to compose programmatic works. Unable to use the technique of word painting, Beethoven had to think out of the box when trying to convey these scenes of a countryside. 

Beethoven had a love of nature, and here is a quote taken from one of his notebooks (translated into English, of course):

<i>“How happy I am to be able to walk among the shrubs, the trees, the woods, the grass and the rocks! For the woods, the trees and the rocks give man the resonance he needs."</i>

Let’s see how Beethoven translates the countryside into the music, as well some difference between the Pastoral and his more Heroic, extroverted writing.

<div class="header">Erwachen heiterer Empfindungen bei der Ankunft auf dem Lande</div>

The first movement of the Pastoral describes an “awakening of cheerful feelings upon arrival in the country.” Here we see an important distinction in the Pastoral and the few programmatic works of the past, such as Vivaldi’s Four Seasons. The Pastoral does not just describe a picture, it also describes emotions. While this first movement has the obvious programmatic elements such as bird calls in the flute, it also has through sound implies the <i>feelings</i> of arriving in the countryside. There’s a lot to talk about here, but I want to focus on the development of the first theme in this movement. I think Beethoven’s transformation of this first theme is one of the most efficient uses of any short phrase of music, and here are the roots of late Beethoven’s ability to write huge works using tiny themes. To do this, he employs a technique I refer to as “melody fragmentation”, where he breaks up the music into small pieces with short glimpses of phrase. These short, broken up melodies are extremely evident in his late piano sonatas and string quartets.

The piece opens with only the string orchestra, as they play the main theme in its full 4 bars.

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/beethoven1.png" alt=""> 

An interesting quirk of this movement is how Beethoven doesn’t copy and paste this theme very often, instead he uses rhythmic motifs to give us a sense of the theme without repeating it note for note. For this, the second and third bars of this theme are the most exciting, with Beethoven using the rhythms of these bars repeatedly over the course of this movement. The rhythms are very simple, but used to great effect. Beethoven was a master of this kind of writing, we see it again in the second movement of the Seventh symphony. However, whilst the Fifth and Seventh symphonies have heavy, march-like rhythms, this one dances with its quavers and semiquavers. An early example of this is in bar 14, where the rhythm of the second bar is played repeatedly in the first violin for more than 10 bars, giving the entire opening a very light and free feel.

Beethoven uses this idea again in the first bars of the development, seen below:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/beethoven2.png" alt=""> 
<div class="captions">The rhythm of bar 2 of the theme</div>

In another example, both the rhythm and melody from the third bar is developed by the flute in sequence; this is the final appearance of this theme in the symphony.

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/beethoven3.png" alt=""> 
<div class="captions">The rhythm of bar 3 of the theme</div>

There are many more examples of these little tidbits of the theme, and much of the music is made from this first four bar phrase, either melodically or rhythmically. What is even more exciting is the short melodies that don’t come from the theme, but instead come as surprises for the audience. There is a fantastic little clarinet solo in the coda, for instance:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/beethoven4.png" alt=""> 
<div class="captions">At first it seems like a transformation of the original rhythmic motif, but we are surprised by the triplets in the fourth bar</div>

An uninformed listening of this movement can result in the audience feeling like the music is very repetitive. However, the repetition of the theme is very clever, and Beethoven also uses different timbres to keep the music fresh, most notably the use of the French horn and its warmer colours. The rather extended coda also adds a lot of new ideas to the music, and most interestingly the music ends <i>piano</i>, despite most of the coda being <i>forte</i>. This leads nicely into the peaceful second movement. Importantly this transition is not <i>attacca</i>, there is a break in the music here to give it time to settle.

<div class="header">Scene Am Bach (Scene by the Brook)</div>

The second movement is also in sonata form, and I would say that it is the most programmatic of the five movements of this symphony. It is in the subdominant, a fourth up rather than in the dominant or relative minor which is slightly more common. Beyond the obvious, such as Beethoven writing the names of birds next to some of the woodwind parts, there are also certain textures that really evoke a sense of nature in this movement. The second violin with its endless semiquavers certainly reminds me of the ebb and flow of a brook; Beethoven has imitated water in sound a century before Debussy and Ravel. Later, other instruments will take these semiquavers, changing the clarity and current of the water. From a technical standpoint, these semiquavers also push the music forward, keeping with the tempo marking of <i>Andante con moto</i> (with movement). This is not a draggy <i>Adagio</i>, as the countryside is full of life and such a tempo marking would be out of place here.

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/beethoven5.png" alt=""> 
<div class="captions">The sound of water in the Classical Period</div>

The second movement also has more great examples of melody fragments, and there is one of my favourite ones in the flute, appearing in the exposition and then repeated in the recapitulation. This melody truly comes out of nowhere, as before this the flute honestly has not had much to do:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/beethoven6.png" alt=""> 

Suddenly the flute has this wonderful line, like a bird taking flight. However, it only lasts one bar, and just as it starts it has ended (In typical Beethoven fashion, it doesn’t properly resolve). This fragment is later passed into the bassoon and developed into a proper second theme, but this first appearance although incomplete is for me the most precious. We only hear this twice, and the understanding that less is more really applies here. Later in his life, Beethoven often saved beautiful melodies to be used sparingly, once or at most twice. In the Op.109 piano sonata, we are treated to one of the most expressive melodies I have ever heard:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/beethoven7.png" alt=""> 
<div class="captions">Bar 14 of the first movement</div>

This melody is played only once, and it still manages to be one of my favourites. Beethoven’s detractors often claim he wasn’t capable of writing a good melody, but that is plainly false. He simply realised that it wasn’t essential for every piece of music to have a <i>expressivo</i> or <i>dolce</i> moment, but when he wanted to write singing melodies, he used them as effectively as any other composer.

I claimed it was obvious just now, but it is impossible to discuss programmatic elements without referring to the most blatant example in the entire symphony. In the coda of this movement, birds are assigned to the woodwinds: a nightingale for flute, quail in the oboe and owl for the clarinet.

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/beethoven8.jpg" alt="By 尖尖的鹿角 - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=10063622"> 

Although Beethoven was not as bold as modern composers who often record these sounds and throw them directly into the music, this imitation of a bird’s song is one of the first examples of composers thinking along these lines. He recognised that instruments are more than just a set of mechanical tones, and can with some imagination on the part of the listener be viewed as many different things. Beethoven was a pioneer in this respect, trying to paint this picture without the explicit use of text. Although frankly speaking these notes can never truly sound like birds, (what kind of birds can sing so perfectly in tune and tempo with each other!) the idea is there. In fact, I honestly prefer this approximation rather than recording the real sounds, which is somewhat popular among composers today. If I want to listen to what nature <i>really</i> sounds like, I’ll have a walk down the park, not go to a concert hall.

<div class="header">Lustiges Zusammensein der Landleute (Merry gathering of country folk)</div>

With the third movement, I will look at how Beethoven treated form in this symphony. Beethoven loved to twist the standard forms of his time, and experimented with many different structures in his music. The first thing of note is how the Pastoral has five movements, instead of the usual four. But the 3rd to 5th movements are all joined with attacca endings, so it can also be considered three-movement symphony. The third movement is the first time Beethoven leaves out the standard sonata form, which makes it interesting from this point of view. What we do have is something similar yet somehow different.

The movement can be split into three parts, like a sonata form. However, I think it is closer to a sort of rondo form, A B A B A’. The B section starts with the “a tempo allegro” marking, and a change from counting one in a bar to three in a bar. After the first two sections, there is a repeat sign, and they are repeated note for note, at least on paper. Any changes in character or colour are left to the conductor’s discretion. In A’ the A section is developed slightly in the original material and contains an additional coda marked <i>Presto</i> as we rush into the fourth movement, which depicts a thunderstorm. A, B and A’ are all in F major, and the movement doesn’t travel the keys as much as a sonata form movement would.

From the above description, the movement sounds rather boring; there is a lot of repeated material and a seemingly basic harmonic language. Despite this, there are still some great moments in this movement, as Beethoven expands on the idea of the countryside. There is additional colour with the scoring of a trumpet in C, the first brass instrument in this symphony save the French horn which is present throughout. Here the trumpet only plays in the B section, and has just two notes: the tonic and dominant. Don’t be disappointed however, this is just the first taste of brass writing we have in the symphony, and more instruments and textures will be added in the coming movements. I think Beethoven put these colours in to “tune” the ears of the audience to the new brass timbre, which of course will lead to the world premiere trombones in the final movement (technically more like one hour after world premiere, because the Fifth also has trombones. But you get the point). 

There is also a wonderful wind quartet in the A’ section, a welcome breath of fresh air after we have heard the A section twice. Underneath the winds, the strings only play pizzicato F naturals with the French horn, allowing the birds of the wind section to sing. The melody here taken explicitly by the flute and hidden in the other instruments is another example of the soaring, vocal melodies Beethoven was capable of writing. Once again, he has saved it for a special occasion and highlighted it with the change of timbre.

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/beethoven9.png" alt=""> 

Lastly, we look to the <i>attacca</i> ending of this movement. Compared to the <i>attacca</i> in the Fifth Symphony, where the third movement blends seamlessly into the fourth, this one is a surprise. A <i>fortissimo</i> dominant chord does not resolve, but instead moves a semitone up to <i>pianissimo</i> D flats in the cello and double bass to signify the coming of the storm. In most recordings, these D flats are barely audible. This <i>fortissimo</i> to <i>pianissimo</i> is an inversion of the attacca in the Op.81a Piano Sonata, where the second movement goes from a whisper to a full dominant seventh chord in the third movement. That kind of transition between movements is far more indicative of Heroic Beethoven, and it is only apt that he reverses it for his more introspective works. As he grew older, he became more and more fond of this <i>subito</i> piano effect, using it in both his big and small works.

<div class="header">Gewitter Sturm (Thunderstorm)</div>

Of course, Beethoven is nothing without some stormy music, as evidenced by his earlier <i>Tempest</i> Sonata written in 1802 (Yes, I know the <i>Tempest</i> wasn’t given its name by Beethoven, nor does it refer to a storm but instead refers to the Shakespeare play. It’s still stormy music nonetheless). From the quiet opening in the strings, suddenly all the instruments come crashing in at bar 21. This time, Beethoven has used timpani to portray thunder crashing over the countryside. Beethoven was the forefather of timpani writing, using it liberally in his late works, such as the second movement of his Ninth Symphony or the Credo of the <i>Missa Solemnis</i>. In this movement, the timpani mostly play trills, for rumbling far away thunder, or short <i>sforzando</i> notes. These shorter notes are almost always syncopated with the rest of the instruments, like how lightning comes a split second before thunder.

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/beethoven10.png" alt=""> 
<div class="captions">The short, syncopated timpani notes are in the bottom staff</div>

Beethoven has also added to the anxiety of this movement with his use of polyrhythmic writing in the lower strings. Complex polyrhythms were still rare in Beethoven’s time, with most composers sticking to the simplest 3 against 2. However, here the cello plays 5 notes to the 4 in the double bass (surely a conductor’s nightmare!), which creates a sense of uneasiness that permeates the entire movement. This is especially so when the thunder lets off for a moment and we only hear the trembling quintuplets in the cello against the semiquavers of the double bass.

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/beethoven11.png" alt=""> 
<div class="captions">bars 24-25</div>

The strings in general are worked extremely hard in this movement, in fact for most of it the longest note value written in the first violin is a quaver. However finally at the end when the storm has passed, the strings play long sustained notes, providing harmony for a short oboe solo. It is like rays of sun peeking out from behind the clouds while finally the song of a bird can be heard now that the storm is silent. 

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/beethoven12.png" alt=""> 
<div class="captions">Dolce and pianissimo in the strings, the storm has passed</div>

Another bird in the flute takes up this melody, ending in a scale that moves into the final movement; this is a far smoother <i>attacca</i> than what we heard before. Now we see how Beethoven has made the Pastoral feel like it has four movements, the same as every symphony written before this point. Yet the fact that the Pastoral has five movements is extremely significant as this was unprecedented no matter how many movements were taken <i>attacca</i>. Depending on your point of view, this symphony can feel like a three, four or five movement symphony. This was a big inspiration to composers such as Liszt and Mahler to further experiment with the standard form of a symphony. Schumann especially played with this idea in his fourth symphony, where every movement is taken <i>attacca</i>. Does it have four movements, or just one big one? These ideas can all be traced back to Beethoven.

<div class="header">Frohe und dankbare Gefuhle nach deh Sturm (Thankful feelings after the storm)</div> 

In this final movement, the symphony comes full circle. The first movement was about an awakening of happy feeling after arriving at the countryside, and this one is about thankful feelings after the storm. We have three more explicitly programmatic movements sandwiched between these two more abstract ones. These movements really feel like each other, both in tempo and in character. They are in the same key. They are both in duple time, but of course this last movement is in a compound duple 6/8 compared to the 2/4 of the first movement. This naturally lends it a dance-like, joyful feel; but it is also somehow the most tranquil movement of the five in my opinion, as well as my personal favourite.

The dancing is obvious from a look at the introduction of the movement by the clarinet, where the theme is more rhythmic than melodic:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/beethoven13.png" alt=""> 
<div class="captions">Clarinet introduction, written pitch</div>

This is the kind of rhythmic motif that Beethoven often used to give music a pulse, with the fate motif being the most famous example. However, in this context it is completely different, the almost swing-like rhythm feels flexible and is reminiscent of the villagers mixing and relaxing after the storm. Beethoven need not be as metronomic in feel as we imagine him to be, it all depends on the character of the work. This should of course still be played in time, but it just seems less strict. The first and only subject is a variation of this idea, and is also in a similar rhythm:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/beethoven14.png" alt=""> 

This is developed into a quick melody fragment that first appears in the viola and cello. This melody also has this rhythm:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/beethoven15.png" alt=""> 
<div class="captions">I use the cello instead of the viola as an example so no one has to deal with alto clef</div>

It’s really simple, but to finally hear a fresh melody in the strings after several bars of only tremolos beneath multiple versions of the first subject in almost every instrument is an amazing moment. As this movement only has one heavily developed theme, these melody fragments are even more important to provide variety. Notice too how the last beat of this fragment heavily implies the theme all the way from the first movement in its rhythm. This fragment is later developed with trills and passed from lower strings to upper strings, all while the winds play harmonies in thirds over these lines. This finally leads to my favourite melody fragment in the entire work:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/beethoven16.png" alt=""> 

This little line from <i>piano</i> to <i>forte</i> for me is the culmination of the whole symphony, the feelings of a countryside expressed in pure sound. It is like the villagers all meeting together after the storm and enjoying their peaceful life, completely tranquil and <i>dolce</i>, free from any worries. What a far cry from the famous C minor works of Beethoven. Even though it is loud, this <i>forte</i>  is completely different from the <i>forte</i>  in the Fifth symphony.

More explicitly, the entire movement summarises the symphony we have heard so far. As discussed, the theme of this last movement is similar to the first one, and the endless semiquavers of the brook are also present here in the strings. The meeting of the villagers is obvious, such as in the line above, with the idea of short melodies coming together to form larger harmonies. The storm of the fourth movement is even present in some <i>fortissimo</i> sections, that even have some diminished sevenths thrown in. However, in the context of the last movement these sections are completely different. 

This summary of all the movements of the symphony is like the second movement of the Appassionata (which was likely written at the same time); in the final variation there everything we have heard so far takes on a different quality. In his Ninth symphony, Beethoven would also recall the themes of the previous movements in the final movement, changing their meanings. I think that the seed of this idea has been planted here, more than twenty years before.

<div class="header">The Entire Story</div> 

I’ve gone through each movement one by one, but as with any symphony or sonata the Pastoral needs to be listened to from start to finish to truly understand it. I would say it is especially important in this case, as the entire symphony tells a clearly defined story. There are some overarching ideas that encompass the entire work that can be observed when doing so. For instance, Beethoven largely avoided writing big orchestral sounds, instead choosing to focus on each section at once. Only in the storm of the fourth movement does the entire orchestral truly play together <i>fortissimo</i>. In the other movements, first the strings will take the theme, then the winds. This gives the symphony a much lighter texture compared to the Fifth or Seventh symphonies that it sits between, while still maintaining the large range of orchestral colours that set Beethoven apart from his contemporaries. This is another reason why the <i>forte</i> in this symphony can take on a different character when compared to his other symphonies, simply put less instruments are playing the same thing at once.

In terms of special instrumentation, there is the vital French horn that is present in every movement of this symphony. The symphony is light on brass, except in the final movements, and the warmth of the French horn is needed to balance out the bright tones of most of the other instruments. I think that the countryside we imagine does have this warmth, Beethoven did not want us to think of a farm stuck in the depth of winter, surrounded by ice. This is the countryside in the spring, when it is the most vibrant and beautiful.
Finally, the interval of a fourth is elevated very much in this symphony. This contrasts with its brother symphony the Fifth, where in my opinion the third is the most common interval (being the first interval in the fate motif). The Pastoral is full of fourths in its themes and even in the fragmented melodies that are so common; and of course, the usage of more plagal cadences compared to perfect ones gives the symphony a more feminine feel. There is also the movement from the tonic to the subdominant and then back to the tonic in the first three movements. It lacks the sense of finality of the Heroic works, just as the interval of a fourth lacks the finality of a perfect fifth. This cannot be considered a bad thing, and in actuality Beethoven proved his versatility as a composer here. It is a shame that some people have a very fixed and often wrong opinion when it comes to his character and music. Beethoven was a great composer, and mastered many styles of composition; his music isn’t just C minor and diminished seventh chords!

Honestly, when I first listened to the Beethoven symphonies I was not a huge fan of the Pastoral, considering it largely inferior to the bigger music in the odd numbered symphonies. However, over the past few months it has become possibly my favourite Beethoven symphony (it’s hard to compete with the Eroica!). There is a different depth to this music that is refreshing and honestly rarely found, with most romantic composers latching on to the Heroic Beethoven and publishing works that were larger and larger in scale. If we look at Brahms especially, I think his symphonies lack this introspective writing, except perhaps for a scant few moments in his Second Symphony. Composers expanded music until people couldn’t take it anymore, and so the minimalist movement was born. I think the Pastoral strikes a good balance between large-scale music and smaller, introverted works. It is definitely fit for performance and can be appreciated by a large audience. Therefore, I hope that these works won’t take second stage to more flashy, grandiose music, and instead will share an equal spotlight in our music players and concert halls.
