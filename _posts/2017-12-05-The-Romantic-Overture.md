The overture is one of the staples of classical music, and yet it has lost some of its original purpose over time. Audiences were quieter, and composers felt like they didn’t need a large instrumental piece to introduce the opera and grab the attention of the people. In the late 19th century, many composers abandoned the overture altogether, notably Puccini’s operas rarely have an overture and burst straight into the singing. Other composers began to write overtures without operas; Brahms wrote two overtures but never touched the opera. People began to wonder, is the overture an essential component in an opera? 
 
The distinction between opera and overture has only been exacerbated today with concerts often programming overtures without the attached opera. <i>William Tell, Carmen</i>, and many more are often played regularly in concert halls, yet to stage those operas is such a monumental task that those are performed much more rarely. We are lucky to see these operas once in a decade in our small country of Singapore. In fact, many of these overtures are tremendously famous, to the point where many people today are familiar with the tunes, yet also completely unaware of their origins.

In the Classical Period however, this was not the case. Overtures then were a key part of the music, if only to shut the audience up before the performance. This is why most overtures of this period start with large <i>tutti</i> chords, meant to tell the audience that the performance was starting right now. In a way, this is not too different from today when the adverts end in a cinema and the opening theme of a famous movie plays. However, brilliant composers also saw the possibility of making these overtures into great works of art, incorporating them seamlessly into the actual singing (I talk about the Magic Flute’s overture <a href="http://michaelsmusings.life/posts/The-Magic-Flute-Mozart's-Portrayal-of-Good-and-Evil/">here</a>). Mozart’s overture in <i>Le Nozze Di Figaro</i> is a fantastic piece of music, and goes against tradition by starting with a <i>piano</i> whisper in the strings. 

This wasn’t exactly consistent however, and there are famous stories of how Mozart wrote the <i>Don Giovanni</i> overture in a morning (possibly untrue). Still, the idea that the overture wasn’t actually that important musically is one that has stuck almost till today. I have been to many a concert where me and my friends fidget through the overtures, waiting to hear the big concertos and symphonies that follow. In a way, the overture serves almost as a prelude to the bigger and better things to follow.

As time went on, this attitude continued. The overture to <i>The Barber of Seville</i> (one of my favourite pieces of music), is actually a cut and paste job, taking music from two of Rossini’s previous operas. That’s why the character change in that music is so distinct and exciting; yet this is a blessing born out of laziness on the composer’s part. However, in another Italian master, Verdi, we find what I think are the best examples of overture writing in history. His overtures to <i>Otello</i> and <i>I vespri Siciliani</i> are some of the most dramatic and exciting pieces of music ever written, and I wonder what Verdi could have done with the symphonic form if he ever bothered. However, today we will look at the world’s favourite opera, <i>la Traviata</i>.

<div class="header">Violetta</div>

<i>la Traviata</i> was written at the height of Verdi’s operatic powers, 1851-1853, the years of works such as <i>Il Travatore</i> and <i>Rigoletto</i>. Upon reading the book <i>La Dame aux Camélias</i>, and later watching the adapted play, Verdi was inspired to set this text as the subject of an opera. This opera was originally named Violetta after the main character, and eventually Verdi settled on the name <i>la Traviata</i>. The word “Traviata” isn’t easily translated into English, but it refers to something almost like a woman with a free spirit (Carmen, anyone?). 

Verdi wanted a more provocative subject for his opera, and thus it centres around a prostitute in modern day Venice. The censors, who were already upset at his risqué opera <i>Rigoletto</i>, refused to let the opera be staged unless it took place in the past (clearly, they did not want to celebrate the whoring culture in Italy at the time). Violetta is basically a woman “owned” by the court, and the formal role is of a courtesan, basically a prostitute with high-class clients. However, the actual subject matter of the opera isn’t dirty at all; it actually celebrates how anyone can be a hero in their own story.

However, the news of inevitable censorship as well as a soprano that wasn’t up to Verdi’s standard put the composer and crew in a bad mood throughout rehearsals. This despair carried through to the premiere, which was largely a disaster. This is the opera behind Verdi’s famous letter to his friend Emanuele Muzio, “<i>la Traviata</i> last night a failure. Was the fault mine or the singers'? Time will tell." Today we know it was clearly the shortcomings of the singers, as <i>la Traviata</i> is the most performed opera worldwide.

The role of Violetta is so crucial to the opera that a bad casting caused the music to fall flat on opening night. I would say that <i>la Traviata</i> is the opera that revolves the most around a single character, more so than in <i>Carmen</i>  or <i>Norma</i>. It’s basically a love triangle; the story follows Violetta and her path away from her initial lover Baron Douphol to her true love Alfredo. All the while, she is also sick with tuberculosis which eventually leads to her death at the end of the opera. Despite her sickness, she shows remarkable strength throughout the story, culminating in sacrificing her love for Alfredo to keep him safe from the wrath of the Baron, who challenges him to a duel. Fearing Alfredo will die in the fight, she swears her love to the Baron to keep him safe, disregarding her own feelings for his safety.

Unfortunately, the plot starts to make no sense around this point.

Despite Violetta's efforts, they fight anyway, and it turns out Alfredo wins, injuring the Baron. Alfredo’s father, who was previously against his son getting together with Violetta, gives in and tells Alfredo her plan (which he somehow knows or can infer). Alfredo desperately rushes to see her one last time and although she is dying, she has a miraculous revival to sing one last duet before dying in his arms. The curtains close over C minor chords and the audience is left somewhat confused over the finer details. 

Maybe if I understood Italian the story would make more sense to me, but from reading synopsis after synopsis and listening to the music it all seems a bit jumbled. Even the sudden C minor modulation at the end feels out of place and unprepared, perhaps deliberately to highlight her sudden death. Nonetheless, the intricacies of the plot aren’t that important to the opera, it is Violetta that makes <i>la Traviata</i>. 

Opera doesn’t tell traditional stories; there is usually very little character development that takes place. The characters often begin and end emotionally in the same place. However, Violetta is a more interesting character than that, she’s the antihero who realises she isn’t just a whore and gains the courage to fight for herself and her lover. Her spirit and vigour is played against her sickness for a character that is both interesting and multi-dimensional, at least by operatic standards. However, despite the many arias and duets that reinforce this character, I think we are introduced to Violetta before a word is sung, in the overture.

<div class="header">Act 1</div>

Verdi opts to title the music before the singing a <i>prelude</i> rather than an overture. This is usually how its presented today in concerts, as a <i>preludio</i>. This is important as it ties the music even closer to the opera and its characters than an overture would, since the overture is often as previously discussed somewhat separated from the opera. However, I think Verdi only did this <i>because</i> of the common distinction, and he felt that the overture no longer needed to serve the purpose of keeping an audience silent. It is an overture that has <i>evolved</i> into a prelude, only by name.  

This is even clearer when we finally look at the music, it opens triple piano in only the violins.  The key is kept ambiguous, later we will clearly be in E major, but the first chord is a dark B minor.

This ethereal sound represents the fragility of Violetta; she is actually referred to as <i>eterea</i> (ethereal) by Alfredo, in one of the famous duets of the opera <i>Un dì, felice, eterea</i>. When Violetta was sick, Alfredo visited her every day and kept her company. This is when he initially falls in love with her, and he confesses in the aforementioned duet. However, she rejects him, saying they can only be friends; claiming: <i>Amar non so, nè soffro Un così eroico amor.(I don’t know how to love, I could not feel such a great emotion) </i>. However, something about his heartfelt emotion touches her, and she gives him a flower, asking him to return when it has wilted. I like to think of the wilting of the flower as a parallel to Violetta’s eventual wilting due to her disease, although maybe that’s overthinking it. I did take literature in high school.

<div class="captions">The two voices are very distinct in this duet, both in character and colour</div>

Listening to this duet reveals the sharp characterisation that is a staple of Verdi’s operas. The long, sweeping lines of the strings during the tenor solo are replaced with calls from the woodwinds, in completely different colour and timbre. This relationship between Violetta and Alfredo can once again be seen in the Prelude. After the opening in violins (high voice), the viola and cello join in the tenor range, accompanying the soprano of the violins. This music also incorporates a waltz, a hugely important part of the music and structure of <i>la Traviata</i>.

Naturally, the overture also has a waltz, but before we reach it the violin takes two bars on their own: 

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/traviata2.png" alt="">

Alfredo might be visiting her every day, but bedridden and ill she is most definitely still alone throughout the nights. This poignant phrase is the perfect foil against the lively dance that it precedes.

<div class="header">Waltzing Along</div>
The dance is a key concept of this opera, in fact the action opens in a dance; Violetta is holding a party for her guests and this is where we are introduced to our main characters. Many of the songs in this opera are either 3/4 or some kind of compound time, which is a rhythmic motif that pervades the opera. For the first act especially, it is largely composed with a large inspiration from dance music. The hugely popular<i>brindisi</i> (drinking song) near the opening is a great example of this. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uDo8Iz8LzW4" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I think that this rhythmic dance motif is more important than any of the melodic and harmonic themes throughout. Even the overture, in common 4/4 time has a modified waltz worked into it:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/traviata3.png" alt="">

Over this rhythmic motif lies a crucial melodic motif in this work, the line E-D#-C#-B-A-F#. This line is a simple melody and is so close to a scale, yet with the use of <i>rhythm</i> it too is transformed into something dancing and magical:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/traviata4.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">This line has a wonderful slow lilting feel to it for me</div>

After this line is passed a few times between instruments, we get the most wonderful countermelody in the violins over the same waltz rhythm:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/traviata5.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">This second motif is a lively skipping dance</div>

I absolutely love this little melody. For me, it sounds like Violetta’s dainty steps as she skips across the party, or her strolling down the street in the later famous aria <i>Sempre Libera</i> (another dance-like song where the waltz is clearly heard).

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cFJJ1zFBWgY" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This second melody is once again a simple scale, initially ascending against the descending main melody. It is given life by the sharp, almost double dotted rhythm as it moves up and down the register. The semiquavers of this motif are pushed along with increasing harmonic tension until we reach the end of this prelude/overture, where something else interesting happens.

Instead of a traditional perfect cadence, the music ends in a much less conventional plagal cadence. However, the movement of a “final” fifth can still be seen in the double basses, however this fifth only acts as an inverted fourth. 

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/traviata6.png" alt="">

This feminine ending echoes the subject of the opera; I think <i>la Traviata</i> is a much more feminine opera than similar works with female leads. Not only are the males in this story given little screen time, the major conflict between Alfredo and the Baron takes place entirely off the stage. The opera for the most part follows Violetta <i>only</i>, and we don’t get to see the scenes she doesn’t. There is no heroism in the male part like there is in <i>Carmen</i>, in fact I’d argue Alfredo doesn’t have much of a personality beyond the fact that he loves Violetta. This is a far cry from the usual male protagonist of an opera who usually has his own story (Pinkerton from <i>Madame Butterfly</i> is a great example, time is taken to show he is an awful person despite that opera being focused on and named after Butterfly.)

The plagal cadence also serves another purpose; its lack of finality precedes the reprise of music at the start of Act 3. This is likely another reason that Verdi chose to call the music a Prelude, since it preludes both act 1 and 3. In this final act, many things have changed. It is just after Alfredo and Violetta have broken up to protect him from the Baron, and she is back in her own home slowly dying of the tuberculosis that has been consuming her up to this point. Naturally, there are also big changes in the music to reflect this.

<div class="header">Despair</div>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A1ypRmtJrDE" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The music starts the same way, with the ethereal whisper in the violins. Listeners will almost immediately notice a distinct difference as the music goes on however, this second prelude is full of death. It opens in the forlorn key of C minor, the same key that Violetta will die to at the end of the opera. Worst of all, there is no eventual modulation to E flat major. This overture is starting on the tonic, and will end in this same doomed key.

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/traviata7.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">This reprised material in the strings is about all that is similar between the two preludes</div>

The life of the waltz is also gone, replaced by a more march-like ostinato beat:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/traviata13.PNG" alt="">

Here, there is no attempt to disguise the 4/4 meter. Gone too are the dancing scales from before, replaced by longer, sorrowful weeping lines in the first violin. Violetta’s sense of despair is once again portrayed by the upper strings. There is very little that is dance-like about this second playing of the overture as Violetta lies bedridden. Her freedom is gone, she is once again restrained to the same room for days on end.

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/traviata8.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">The long, melancholy lines of the second prelude</div>

Interestingly, there are also hints of a fate motif in the violins. I don’t like it when people attribute everything to the fate motif, but here it does make sense in the context of the opera. We see this descending accented short-short-short-long motif that should be familiar to us, “the devil knocking on the door of the doomed”:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/traviata9.png" alt="">

The music ends in a very similar way, but with a perfect cadence to the key of C minor this time, the final key. The trill in violin is almost parallel with the semiquavers of the first prelude:  

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/traviata10.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">The music here isn’t very decisive, but the perfect cadence provides a sense of conclusion</div>

This time however, the trill is written freely and is filled with far more nervousness and anxiety. This even as the music quietens to a ridiculous quadruple piano, as only 4 and then 2 violinists play while the rest stay silent. Verdi clearly took the instruction of <i>morendo</i> very seriously, as Violetta dies away in the opera so does the music. The tension of the trill isn’t resolved so much as faded away over time.

Compare this to the tension in the Act 1 prelude; while there was definitely a foreboding sense of danger there it was quickly hidden away amongst the many dancing motifs. See how this dissonant semitone between B and A# is quickly resolved into the two main motifs in the first prelude:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/traviata11.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">The semitone in the cello line (top line, Vc.) is quickly and simply resolved</div>

In this second overture/prelude, all the tension is left to hang as we move into the final act; such as in the unresolved semitones we see below. There’s almost no repeated motivic material in this second prelude to latch onto. Uneasy syncopation and ornamentation only makes this section even more uncomfortable:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/traviata12.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">Every resolution is only fleeting and increases rather than releases the tension</div>

Many of the themes of this second prelude are also reprised in the first recitative of Act 3, a short duet between Violetta and her maid (yes, courtesans were rich enough to have maids in those times). This is music set to Violetta telling her maid about her sickness, asking for water and reminiscing on the past as she approaches inevitable death. Her acceptance of the fact that she will die alone is a big theme in the first half of Act 3 before the couple’s reconciliation. This is the sombre mood that the prelude sets without the use of words. The whole opera takes a dark turn in this final act, and Verdi used the second prelude to prepare us perfectly.

<div class="captions">Annina?... Comandate? The first song of Act 3. Many devices from the second prelude are used here</div>

<div class="header">The Meaning of Music</div>

Music that is programmatic can be a challenge to interpret, and it’s hard to say how much can be expressed explicitly without words. However, with the two preludes in <i>la Traviata</i>, I’d argue that Verdi conveyed the mood of the opera as well as any of the arias can. Leitmotifs <i>a la</i> Wagner can emphasise character traits, but the overall atmosphere of a story is key and instrumental music can perfectly encapsulate this. Just look at modern Hollywood movies to see how important instrumental music is to ambience and atmosphere.

These two preludes prove that instrumental music can also be key storytelling elements of an opera. I hope that instrumental music in large vocal pieces won’t continue to disappear; I think it’s a trend that both musicians and laymen can appreciate. While it is not necessary for every opera to have an overture or prelude, I think that a well thought out piece of instrumental music can set the stage better than any props or acting will ever be able to.
