The Romantic Interpretation of Bach

Learning to enjoy Bach’s music can be a challenge. To many they think he is boring; hampered by the limitations of his instruments and not expressive in his writing. Children are brought up to play Bach on the piano drily and without soul, especially by more inexperienced piano teachers. However, there is a reason his music has stood the test of time. It is music that touches the heart at its most primal level, more so than has been accomplished by another composer except maybe Beethoven.

Why is it then that so many performances of Bach are lacklustre, sometimes even by professional artists? As a student interpreting Bach is definitely something I struggle with, especially as I find that my interpretations can clash with more textbook readings of his works. I think that we have many misconceptions about Bach today, and I hope that the direction we take in performing his works will be able to revitalise his music in the modern repertoire, where I feel like Bach is absent from our large concert halls, replaced by the large scale works of the later composers.

Historical Accuracy

The music of Bach is probably the oldest music still commonly played today, and historical accuracy is always a big point when people discuss performances of his music. I think that while historical accuracy to some degree has its importance, we should not neglect the capabilities of our modern instruments when performing his music. It is clear to me that Bach was looking to the future in his writing, so we should not limit his music by using his instruments which lack colour and aren’t appropriate for a big concert hall. Intimate settings of Bach are fine, but exposure of his music to a wider audience is desperately needed today.

The Music of Bach

Now we get to the meat of the topic, why I personally believe in my interpretations of Bach. To me, Bach is closer to the romantic music of the 19th century than Mozart or Haydn. Here I will show how he is often more daring and creative in his writing than the composers of the Classical Period, truly showing how far ahead of his time he was.

The Bach B Minor Mass is the culmination of Bach’s writing, with most of the music being a parody of his older pieces. However, these 4 opening bars of the Kyrie are believed by most scholars to be original music that Bach wrote. Interestingly, before I wrote this piece I assumed that this music was composed in the late 1740s along with the completion of the Mass. However, these opening bars were conceived as part of the original Missa from which the Mass is born, written in 1733. This just reinforced my belief that Bach was already pushing to a more Romantic style of writing even earlier in his life. Bach has a purpose in writing this original introduction, I think it is to create the darkest, coldest sound possible to open this two hour Mass, which will eventually end in the warmness of the relative D major.

Here we can see how every note matters in Bach’s writing. Contrary to popular claims of his music being uninteresting harmonically, here in the first three chords we already see how he shades the music with a wealth of colours through his clever use of harmony. The key here is in the second chord, with the passing A natural in the tenor voice. Instead of simply copy-pasting the first chord onto the second beat for an uninteresting i-iv progression, the A natural darkens this progression and leads to an inevitable minor four chord with an added sixth in the bass. Within these three chords there is expression and emotion enough to match the highest points of the Mahler symphonies.
 
Opening 3 chords of the Kyrie, descending tenor line in red, the key sixth note of the bass in blue. These coloured notes contain all the excitement of this music.
Harmonic writing is perhaps the most important aspect of choral compositions, but here Bach also shows his understanding of individual melody lines within the harmony. I would like to draw attention to the second soprano line in bars 1-2:
 
 Opening second soprano line, flattened notes in blue
For me, this is the first completed phrase Bach has written. The line starts clearly in B minor, with Bach using the triplet figure at the end of bar 1 to push towards the dominant of F sharp. These three notes are the only notes present here, all other instruments and voices are silent, and listeners eagerly await the crashing chord of the dominant, A#-C#-F#. However, immediately after that in bar 2 we see Bach flatten these notes from A and C sharp to A and C natural. 
  
The expected dominant progression                        The unexpected diminished chord in the actual music

Once again, this darkens the tone in a similar way to the descending tenor line from moments ago where instead of a dominant chord, we get a diminished sound. The genius of this writing is in how Bach has subverted our expectation of the dominant and replaced it with the subdominant; which is an exact mirroring of the first three chords! With the thought and creativity put into this music, Bach has achieved a tone that is so dark it could send chills down anyone’s spine. How fitting for the words “Kyrie eleison” (trans. Lord, have mercy [upon us]).

Bach shows an originality in his writing not just in the sense of melody and harmony, but also in structure. This opening four bar introduction is hard to link to the rest of the Kyrie, at least from a purely theoretical point of view. However, upon listening I do get the sense that they are somehow linked; it just feels right. Maybe I am missing something, or maybe not everything in music can be clearly defined in such a “scientific” sense. Either way, I think that this idea of a loosely connected introduction is extremely Romantic in nature. Consider the opening of the unfinished Schubert symphony or the first bars in the Schumann and Grieg piano concertos.  This idea is somewhat lost by Classical composers, where the theme is presented as soon as possible. It is Beethoven who revived this tradition, and many say that he was a flagbearer for Romantic music. I dare to say many of these ideas originated in Bach, and in Beethoven’s music there are many homages to Bach, such as his obsession with fugal writing in his later and more Romantic period.

A more indepth and slightly boring analysis of these 4 bars:
This turned out to be way WAY more difficult than I expected, and really shows the depth of Bach’s writing. Hopefully I didn’t make any terrible mistakes. But first, a scary graphic:

Here we can see the previously discussed tenor line in red and the flattening of the second soprano line to form a diminished harmony in blue in context. 




Bach and Pianists 
When Bach is brought up among pianists, immediately their concern is to the pedal. However, I think the real issue is not the pedal, but what the pedal potentially represents to many pianists. With the pedal, we gain a whole new palette of colour, and a singing tone that defies the percussive nature of our instrument. It is much easier to express with the pedal than without. I think that it is foolish to say we should never let ourselves use this tool to enrich our sound. What is most important is that we do not allow our playing to ever be boring or mindless, whether we use the pedal or not. Bach may not be romantic in the exact sense of Chopin, but the emotions in his music are laid bare for all to see. As musicians, we strive to share these emotions with an entire concert hall, and Bach has as many colours and emotions as any other great composer.

Bach was a pioneer, and without him music today might sound much different. To those unsure about my ideas, I would ask: Would Bach worry about handicapping himself, or would he use whatever was available to deliver the most convincing art? It is impossible for me to know Bach's exact idea on how to play his music, I can only try to use what is known about his music and his life and try to channel his spirit through my playing.
