Learning to enjoy Bach’s music can be a challenge. To many they think he is boring; hampered by the limitations of his instruments and not expressive in his writing. Children are brought up to play Bach on the piano drily and without soul, especially by more inexperienced piano teachers. However, there is a reason his music has stood the test of time. It is music that touches the heart at its most primal level, more so than has been accomplished by another composer except maybe Beethoven.

Why is it then that so many performances of Bach are lacklustre, sometimes even by professional artists? As a student interpreting Bach is something I struggle with, especially as I find that my interpretations can clash with more textbook readings of his works. I think that we have many misconceptions about Bach today, and I hope that the direction we take in performing his works will be able to revitalise his music in the modern repertoire. My piano teacher told me that when she was young and studying in London, every Good Friday and Easter there would be a performance of the St John and Matthew Passions. I am so jealous of her experience, as nowadays Bach is absent from our large concert halls, replaced by the large scale works of the later composers. What a shame, as Bach is certainly one of the greatest composers to have ever lived.

<div class="header">Historical Accuracy</div>

The music of Bach is probably the oldest music still commonly played today, and historical accuracy is always a big point when people discuss performances of his music. While historical accuracy has its importance, we should not neglect the capabilities of our modern instruments when performing his music. Bach was looking to the future in his writing, so I think we should not limit his music by using his instruments which lack colour and aren’t appropriate for a big concert hall. Intimate settings of Bach are fine, but exposure of his music to a wider audience is desperately needed today.

<div class="header">The Music of Bach</div>

Now we get to the meat of the topic, why I personally believe in my interpretations of Bach. To me, Bach is closer to the romantic music of the 19th century than Mozart or Haydn. <sup title="It’s not that these composer’s works aren’t expressive, simply that the style of Bach’s expression is more akin to the Romantic expression.">1</sup>
Here I will try to show how he is often more daring and creative in his writing than the composers of the Classical Period, proving that while he might not be romantic in the sense of Chopin, he understood how to translate feelings and colours onto a manuscript page in a very direct fashion.

The Bach B Minor Mass is for me the pinnacle of Bach’s writing, with most of the music being a parody of his older pieces. It can be thought of as his compilation of the music he was most proud of. However, the 4 opening bars of the Kyrie we will discuss are believed by most scholars to be original music that Bach wrote. Interestingly, before I wrote this piece I assumed that this music was composed in the late 1740s along with the completion of the Mass. In fact, these opening bars were conceived as part of the original Missa from which the Mass is born, written in 1733. This just reinforced my belief that Bach was already pushing to a more Romantic style of writing even earlier in his life. 

Bach has a purpose in writing this original introduction, I think it is to create the darkest, coldest sound possible to open this two hour Mass, which will eventually end in the warmness of the relative D major.

Here we can see how every note matters in Bach’s writing. Contrary to popular claims of his music being uninteresting harmonically, in the first three chords we already see how he shades the music with a deep colour through his clever use of harmony. The key here is in the second chord, with the passing A natural in the tenor voice. Instead of simply copy-pasting the first chord onto the second beat for an uninteresting i-iv progression, the A natural darkens this progression and leads to an inevitable minor four chord with an added sixth in the bass. Within these three chords there is expression and emotion enough to match the highest points of the Mahler symphonies.

Harmonic writing is perhaps the most important aspect of choral compositions, but here Bach also shows his understanding of individual melody lines within the harmony. I would like to draw attention to the second soprano line in bars 1-2:

<div class="captions">Opening second soprano line, flattened notes in blue</div>
For me, this is the first completed phrase Bach has written, a beautiful melody for the female voice.<sup title="Interestingly, this phrase does not last the entire two bars, although for me it is definitely complete. More creative writing!">2</sup> 
It is really quite tender and sweet compared to the rest of the music, but in hiding it beneath the first sopranos Bach has used it to enhance the other lines rather than overpower it. Writing little gems like this in the secondary voices also gives the careful listener many new rewards when they listen to the work for the second, third or hundredth time (in my case). The line starts clearly in B minor, with Bach using the triplet figure A#-C#-E at the end of bar 1 to push towards the dominant of F sharp. These three notes are the only notes present here, all other instruments and voices are silent, and listeners eagerly await the crashing chord of the dominant, A#-C#-F#. However, immediately after that in bar 2 we see Bach flatten these notes from A and C sharp to A and C natural.

<div class="captions">The unexpected diminished chord in the actual music</div>

Once again, this darkens the tone in a similar way to the descending tenor line from moments ago where instead of a dominant chord, we get a diminished sound. The genius of this writing is in how Bach has subverted our expectation of the dominant and replaced it with the subdominant; which is an exact mirroring of the first three chords!

With the thought and creativity put into this music, Bach has achieved a tone that is so dark it could send chills down anyone’s spine. How fitting for the words “Kyrie eleison” (trans. Lord, have mercy [upon us]).

Bach shows an originality in his writing not just in the sense of melody and harmony, but also in structure. This opening four bar introduction is hard to link to the rest of the Kyrie, at least from a purely theoretical point of view. However, upon listening I do get the sense that they are somehow connected; it just <i>feels</i> right. Maybe I am missing something, or maybe not everything in music can be clearly defined in such a “scientific” sense. Either way, I think that this idea of a loosely connected introduction is extremely Romantic in nature. Consider the opening of the unfinished Schubert symphony or the first bars in the Schumann and Grieg piano concertos.  This idea is somewhat lost by Classical composers, where the theme is often presented as soon as possible. It is Beethoven who revived this tradition, and he was a flagbearer for Romantic music. Many of these ideas originated in Bach. In Beethoven’s music, there are many homages to Bach, such as his obsession with fugal writing in his later and more Romantic period.

<div class="header">A more indepth analysis of these 4 bars</div>

Disclaimer: This turned out to be way more difficult than I expected, and really shows the depth of Bach’s writing. Hopefully I didn’t make any terrible mistakes. Only read if you love harmony.

<div class="captions">Condensed form of the choral writing in bars 1-4. A few notes have been edited out for clarity</div>

Here we can see the previously discussed tenor line in red and the flattening of the second soprano line to form a diminished harmony in blue in context. 

Previously I mentioned that these 4 bars are Bach’s attempt to create a dark sound to begin this religious work. However, there is also a technical motive behind the writing, to reach the dominant chord of F# major to “lead in” to the rest of the Kyrie, a fugue in B minor. He could have done this quite simply as would be the style of early Haydn or Mozart, but instead he has chosen a rather complex chord progression which I have filled in above. 

Grey chords are to me less important and more like decorations of the harmony, while the chords in black form the backbone of this progression. Rather interestingly the VI7 chord has a raised seventh suspended from the previous bar (the soprano F#), creating what is a very modern major seventh sound favoured by composers such as Debussy and Poulenc. Bach is looking ahead, but in hiding this harmony a little with the suspension, remains grounded in slightly more traditional harmony. Another originality is in the final cadence, while ii7-V is a common imperfect cadence, Bach uses a G in the bass instead of the traditional C#. He avoids the fifth in the bass and instead continues the stepwise bass movement, where the biggest leap we have had so far is no more than a major third in bar 3. This stepwise movement allows the top lines of the progression to really shine, without breaking them up with sudden jumps in the bass that can make the music seem a little jolted, especially with the dotted march-like rhythm of the first sopranos. 

The most interesting harmonic writing here is Bach’s juxtaposition of dominant and diminished chords. In the alto line of bar 2 (notes in green), we see the dominant seventh of E minor, which leads to the next three notes in the soprano line (notes in purple). This dominant seventh line is then mirrored by the tenors at the beginning or bar 3; this time the dominant seventh of B minor, which eventually lands on the F# which is the bass of the ic chord. This F# is significant in that it is the first time we have heard it in the bass, and while it has not yet reached the finality of the V chord, the ic chord is like a weaker version of the eventual dominant as it shares the same bass. This foreshadows where the progression will end a bar later.

Those are the dominant chords, and how they push the progression forward. However often the progression faces resistance from their counterparts, the diminished chords. There are two diminished chords which push against the natural direction of this progression, namely the chords at the beginning of bars 2 and 3. Both are led to by a triplet figure from the second soprano (notes in purple). Let’s compare them. The first is spelt D#-F#-A, it does not have a seventh note. However, the second is spelt A#-E-C#-G, which does have a seventh note, and I think it is the strongest possible arrangement of the notes in a diminished seventh. This is because of how it stacks two tritones, the most dissonant of intervals directly on top to each other.

Bach further emphasised this idea with their preparing notes, the first chord is prepared by the three notes A#-C#-E, while the second is prepared by B-E-G. The second preparation is more expanded, spanning a sixth instead of a fourth. This is as if it is reaching for a higher point, only to be stopped by a discordant diminished seventh chord that pushes back against it, as if to say that it is not yet time for us to reach the dominant. Bach pushes against the dominant twice, first weakly and then the second time stronger, until finally the music breaks through with the full F# major chord. There are no 7ths here in the last chord to imply the voice leading to the B minor chord, here the progression is concluded totally <i>first</i>, before the fugue is allowed to come in. Using these techniques, Bach has managed to spend a good 30 seconds or so before finally finishing this little i-V progression without any of the music being boring or predictable. Once again, this is something Beethoven would adopt in his later writing, where we are left waiting and waiting for a resolution (perhaps sometimes left waiting too long!).

<div class="header">Bach and Pianists</div>

When Bach is brought up among pianists, immediately their concern is to the pedal. However, I think the real issue is not the pedal, but what the pedal potentially represents to many pianists. With the pedal, we gain a whole new palette of colour, and a singing tone that goes against the percussive nature of our instrument. It is much easier to express with the pedal than without. If one thinks it is possible to achieve the deep emotion of Bach’s music without the pedal, then I encourage him to go for it. Personally, I do not think it can be done, at least not in every piece. <b>Regardless, what is most important is that we do not allow our playing to ever be boring or mindless, whether we use the pedal or not.</b> As musicians, we strive to share outwards the emotions within our music to an entire concert hall, and Bach has as many colours and emotions as any other composer.

I think every pianist should play Bach, and it is good to have a Bach piece in the fingers at any given time. It is a privilege that pianists can play polyphonic music by themselves, even if it can be a pain to learn sometimes. As Bach's music does not have fiery technical passages, I like to start my practice with a small Bach prelude or one of the movements from his partitas or suites. This music is lighter than the compositions of Rachmaninoff or Liszt, and is a good warmup both physically and mentally. Careful study of the Bach fugues (all masterpieces) is also helpful for having a stronger musical memory, and is something I would like to work on more in the future.

For less advanced students, the Bach inventions are a priceless resource. A particular favourite of mine to teach is the E major invention in BVW 792. This invention has the simplest of themes with only intervals of seconds and one third interval, yet there are so many touching moments in this one minute of music. The character and presentation of the music lends itself to the use of some tactful rubato, and I like to use this invention to show my students how Bach can be played in a way that doesn't make it sound like a metronome. It is relatively easy to play but has so much musical value, and I highly suggest you give it a listen.

<div class="captions">J.S.Bach Invention No.6 in E Major, BWV 792</div>
Above is a recording of this invention by Andras Schiff. Schiff is well known for not using pedal in his playing, and although I do not agree with his interpretations all the time, here he has managed to capture the essence of this invention with a very musical reading. The theme is played almost <i>cantabile</i> and while singing, Schiff does not allow the music to drag as the running triplet figures push it along. Notice how the playing is not metronomic in the slightest, he often takes "breaths" to prepare new harmonies or surprises in the music.

Bach was a pioneer, and without him music today might sound much different. To those unsure about my ideas, I would ask: Would Bach worry about handicapping himself, or would he use whatever was available to deliver the most convincing art? It is impossible for me to know Bach's exact idea on how to play his music, I can only try to use what is known about his music and his life and try to channel his spirit through my playing.
