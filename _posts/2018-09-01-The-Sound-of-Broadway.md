Musicals are an art form that I think deserves more discussion by musicians today. Many people enjoy them (far more than classical music I dare say), yet I’ve not met many people who are truly passionate about the music in these <i>music</i>als. Often the focus is on the set, story, characters, costumes; the list goes on. While these things are vital to a successful musical and is a great reason to go and see them, the music of Broadway is something that has interested me for a long time.

I think too many classical musicians have a holier-than-thou attitude when it comes to musicals; what’s the point of listening to some idiots sing and dance in <i>English</i> (!) when we could be listening to a much more romantic language in an Italian opera. I’ve actually heard that operas are high art compared to the low art of musicals. Considering that Broadway was birthed from the opera house in the early 20th century, I consider them equals. Honestly I think it’s probably never right to call certain music objectively worse than others, what we have instead is our own preferences. Hopefully more musicians can try to appreciate music from different genres. In fact I think that Broadway has evolved far more effectively than classical music, hence it retains a large audience even today.

In that line of thought, I decided to look at two musicals, a more classic one and one that came out just last year. <i>Wicked</i> is a musical that is relatively new, debuting in 2003. However, since then it has become the 2nd largest grossing musical in Broadway, one of only three to surpass the 1 billion dollar mark. I think its success is rooted in its traditional fairytale story, and its music similarly shares many Broadway traditions. It’s a musical that is commonly mentioned with other classics like <i>Les Miserables</i>, Phantom of the Opera and The Lion King.

On the other hand, <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i> is a super-modern musical with a story clearly aimed at the liberal majority of New York. While not as groundbreaking as the sensation <i>Hamilton</i>, it certainly takes the art form of the musical in a new direction. The cast is young and act even younger, and the music reflects this with a strong pop-music feel.  While it misses certain aspects of the musical-opera form, it surprisingly has many subtle nods to the old-school musical. Comparing its songs to those in <i>Wicked</i> we can draw many parallels without much effort, and see how <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i> has evolved to appeal to modern audiences.

<div class="header">Openings without Overtures</div>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6f1-QF9jvBM" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The opening of <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i>, <i>Anybody Have a Map?</i> is extremely daring and when I heard it, I honestly thought I was listening to a pop country album. With this one song we can see all the ways it differs from a conventional musical. There’s no big fanfare overture as in the first track No one Mourns the <i>Wicked</i>. Most broadway classics open with a big orchestral number, much like an opera. This is the perfect chance to introduce the leitmotifs that will pervade the opera. Gershwin’s <i>Porgy and Bess</i> overture goes through the leitmotif of literally every major character. For musicals, Look Down from <i>Les Miserables</i> will be remembered as one of the most recognisable motifs to be heard in the first song of a musical.

However, <i>Anybody Have a Map?</i> starts with a quietly strumming guitar in a funky syncopated pattern. It has no leitmotifs throughout, in fact the musical lacks leitmotifs almost entirely bar one or two once-repeated melodies. This is for me the most radical change in <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i> as compared to a traditional musical. Honestly, I don’t think that a musical can be easily remembered without the use of leitmotifs, and <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i> barely pulls it off through other techniques we will look at. It’s definitely also helped by its short 50 minute runtime (sung parts only, I believe the musical lasts nearly 2 hours.)

Despite my personal disappointments at the lack of a recurring motif, there’s still a lot to like about this first song. Many similarities to other musicals are also revealed especially after looking at the score.  Firstly, we can see the syncopation that will be a highlight of this musical (a trait it shares with <i>Wicked</i>).

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/broadway1.png" alt="">

These rhythms portray the awkward scene of a mother talking to her rebellious child, mimicking the hesitations and pauses we have in natural speech. It’s really quite hard to follow this music if you try to sing it without a backing track, but the chords somehow push it on very nicely. This is precisely the secret behind the hit <i>Defying Gravity</i>, the closing number to <i>Wicked</i>’s first act. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yf9Bt5WFZKs" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Not many people notice the syncopation in <i>Defying Gravity</i> because of the flowing orchestral score, but it’s there throughout the entire chorus. Notice how the harmonies in <i>Defying Gravity</i> always come in on the offbeat after 4 just before the barline:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/broadway2.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">The sus2 chords above are all offbeat</div>

<i>Anybody have a Map?</i> is a duet, and comparing it to the duet <i>For Good</i> from <i>Wicked</i> we see something interesting. The staggered entry of the two voices singing similar lyrics is almost identically managed in these two songs.

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/broadway3.png" alt="">
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/broadway4.png" alt="">

In these two examples, the second voice transforms the initial melody just a touch to keep things interesting. In <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i>, Heidi alters the notes on the lyrics “Anybody have a map”, however the rhythm is kept constant (Semiquavers, with the word “map” given a quaver.) On the other hand, in <i>Wicked</i>, the melody is the same, but the rhythm is slightly altered. When the alto voice comes in on “like a seed dropped”), the rhythm is changed to triplets instead of the previous quavers. These subtle parallels tie the two songs together very nicely; these duets are both sung by good friends struggling through difficult circumstances.

<div class="header">Characterisation</div>
Now, let's look at how the music is managed when the singer is solo. In most dramatic musical forms, the main character will get to sing a song or aria that basically introduces them. <i>Waving through a Window</i> and <i>The Wizard and I</i> have so much in common it’s astounding.

<div class="captions">The first bars of these two songs</div>

Already we can tell that the introductions are almost identical. The harmonies are essentially the same; tonic, subdominant, suspended dominant. The harmonic rhythm is exactly the same and we have the repeated quavers pushing the music along. Once again, we see the harmony on the offbeat; a trademark of the Broadway sound. The suspended chords in these progressions are rather interesting, this is a harmony that’s not that often used in classical music but is found very frequently in Broadway. The idea of using suspension in the harmony instead of just the melody is fresh for people who listen to mostly classical music. The alternation of suspended and “normal” chords is a wonderful way of subtly increasing tension:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/broadway7.png" alt="">

Proving their harmonic strength, suspended chords act as the final “cadence” In <i>Waving through a Window</i>! The Isus2 chord actually has a surprising amount in common with V, acting almost like a dominant with a raised third. 

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/broadway8.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">A syncopated example of a similar progression in <i>Wicked</i></div>

The main characters of these two musicals are both misunderstood and lonely, and struggle to accept themselves over the course of the story. While cliché, this is a trope that is effective and I like how their cadences are often altered to seem unsure. In the case of Evan from <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i>, his final cadence in his chorus is decorated with another suspended chord before resolution. See how this cadence is extended:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/broadway9.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">Dsus2 steps in to prolong the progression before we end on the tonic</div>

We see a similar but much more complex extension in the final cadence of The Wizard and I, featuring much more elaborate harmonies, featuring an altered Neapolitan chord:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/broadway10.png" alt="">

Don’t let this fool you, the harmony in <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i> gets quite complex and rich especially in its slower songs. This brings us to the next paur of songs I would like to look at, back to duets and the exploration of the Phrygian and Aeolian modes in Broadway.

<div class="header">Love</div>

Most musicals have a love number, and while <i>Wicked</i>’s famous duet <i>For Good</i> is more about friendship, musically it can be compared quite well to the love song <i>Only Us</i> from <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i>. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PPvO1sZkOx0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CQJaZO2nfGg" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Excitingly, modal interchange is presented frequently in these songs; specifically from the Phrygian/Aeolian modes which to me have a very warm quality (flat major three and flat major six specifically). This example from <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i> features in every chorus of <i>Only Us</i>:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/broadway11.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">bIII is heard in the second system, A(B double flat) major in the key of G flat</div>

In <i>Wicked</i>, we again see a slightly more complex version of this, with the addition of flat major six and seven (Ab and Bb major respectively). This puts it firmly in the Aeolian mode (Phrygian features flat <i>minor</i> seven):

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/broadway12.png" alt="">

These two songs also end on the same chord; the tonic chord with an added second:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/broadway13.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">In another possible connection to the Phrygian mode, <i>Only Us</i> ends a minor third down in key</div>
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/broadway14.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">A cute bit of syncopation in the last few chords of <i>For Good</i></div>

The liberal use of suspended chords as both passing chords and cadences gives a lot of colour to the often simple progressions of musicals. If we look at the example from For Good above, we can see that the entire progression is essentially only made out of the three primary chords in a key. Even with the voices singing only the tonic note, this passage of music is kept exciting with its slight dissonances in the clashing tonic and supertonic. (The chord C/F can be respelled as a Csus4/F, and for me as a classical musician these are basically the same).

We can almost imagine how this would be played in classical music, I could easily see the below example in an aria:
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/broadway15.png" alt="">

The harmonies and chords are similar, but the effect is very different, especially when the harmonic <i>rhythm</i> is altered to be on the beat. Taking the suspensions out of the instrumentation and putting it in the voice also completely transforms the colour. Using these rhythms in a very in-your-face way is one of the tricks these musicals use to produce upbeat tracks that will stick in your head for a long time.

<div class="header">Parody</div>

For our last pair of songs, let’s look at the funny, less serious song. Almost every musical features at least some of these, especially for the longer ones. Lovely Ladies (<i>Les Miserables</i>), Look at Me I’m Sandra Dee (<i>Grease</i>), and the three King George songs from <i>Hamilton</i> are examples that many will know. This is not just because they’re good songs; their cheeky lyrics help us keep the melodies in mind for far longer than we would if they were words that we didn’t even understand. The concept of the funny song is very common in opera as well, Figaro’s aria in The Barber of Seville stands out as a piece that is both virtuosic and yet hilarious when performed well.

<i>Sincerely, Me</i> (<i>Dear Evan Hansen</i>) and <i>Popular</i> (<i>Wicked</i>) are once again two near-perfect parallel songs. As with the main character’s song, the context of these two songs is very close to each other. Both involve a friend giving the main character some much un-needed advice on how to live their lives. They’re both pretty funny especially if you have a child-like (immature) sense of humour like me, but the music of the songs is where they share the most middle ground.

Firstly, the syncopated rhythms are taken to the next level in both of these songs; look at the difficulty of counting some of these lines:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/broadway16.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">This offbeat swing rhythm contrasts the metronomic harmonic rhythm</i></div>

<div class="captions">We have a similarity here in the ties across bar lines that make things confusing</i></div>
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/broadway18.png" alt="">
<div class="captions>Another interesting passage from <i>Sincerely, Me</i> where the accented chords are on the offbeat!</i></div>

Of all the songs I’ve covered, I believe these two to be the most closely linked and I personally think <i>Sincerely, Me</i> was very much inspired by <i>Popular</i>. We can draw some more direct comparisons between these two songs than the other pairs I’ve covered so far. A four note lead-in preceding a modulation is a feature of both songs:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/broadway19.png" alt="">
<div class="captions>Another minor third modulation in <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i></i></div>

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/broadway20.png" alt="">

These songs also end in basically the same way harmonically:
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/broadway21.png" alt="">
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/broadway22.png" alt="">

If we look at the chord before V in the above two examples, we can compare the Bb9 chord in <i>Wicked</i> and the augmented E flat chord in <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i>. In their keys, they are IV9 and bvi+ respectively. I think bvi+ should be respelt Ic+ (2nd inversion augmented 1 chord, I think this is simpler). These chords have a surprising amount in common, 1c+ is rather close to a minor iv chord. iv9 is like the stepping stone between these two chords, and also precedes V nicely because of the shared 5th degree of the scale. Ic+ is definitely the more adventurous chord however.

Here, <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i> is bolder with its harmonic choices, proving that the music of Broadway isn’t necessarily dumbed down like some people might suspect when listening to this “pop musical”. Either way, both musicals spice up the subdominant chord before V in their own special way before ending on a typical third-beat accented chord. A strong “weak ending” like this is very popular in Broadway. It is both humorous and slightly paradoxical, reflecting the song and often the genre perfectly.

<div class="header">Learning From Broadway</div>

Admirably, Broadway has managed to keep up with the times without losing sight of its traditions. I might go into this one day with <i>Hamilton</i>, which is by far the best example of this. The way Lin Manuel Miranda combined hip hop, jazz, old school British boy band music and many under genres into a single work of art is a tremendous achievement. However, even with works that are less once-in-a-lifetime brilliant, it’s clear to me how <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i> balances the tightrope between classical Broadway and something for the millennial generation.

I’m not sure how classical music can be made more accessible (if I did I would be a millionaire), but something has to be done to keep people interested in it. Genuine passion for it shrinks with each generation, and honestly I don’t think we’ve done anything to make it appeal to a large audience. The music is good, so it's definitely possible. If the old-timey streets of Broadway can interest young people with works like <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i>, there must be something we can do to attract people to our great art form.
