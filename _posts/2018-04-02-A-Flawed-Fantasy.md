Being a student in NAFA, I’ve had the privilege of experiencing some great choral repertoire. Although I am a pianists by trade, I’ve always enjoyed choir more than most of my boring performance classes and faculty lessons. From The Creation in my first year to the third Bruckner Mass where we worked with the SSO, choir has largely been a positive experience for me and one of the few reasons for me to consider my time in NAFA valuable.

However, this semester we are singing Beethoven's <i)Choral Fantasy</i>, and preperations have gone from bad to worse. I have nothing against the work; although in my opinion it is a pale reflection of the genius of Beethoven. At best, it’s a draft for the Missa Solemnis and the Ninth, but still it’s a score that can be studied and appreciated by music students. What I do have a problem with is the way this work was rehearsed and the arrangements for its final performance, it’s been an absolute joke throughout. 

Disclaimer: This post is going to be highly opinionated and I might be wrong about some things as I don’t necessarily know the finer details behind the school's motivation, but I’ve sent emails to the faculty with no response and I’m extremely frustrated. I will edit this if someone replies my emails.

The scores we received for this piece are hopelessly inadequate, with no piano accompaniment. This has been standard fare for the NAFA choir for a while now, but this time it's even more offensive to me as the singing parts are only 13 pages long. Printing out a decent score is almost free and will require at most 2 minutes of your time. I calculated it would take about a hundred dollars to provide scores for the entire choir, and I offered to pay for anyone who was willing to print out a score themselves. I could afford this on my sad salary earned from part-time teaching, but perhaps there is a better use of the resources we have in school.

There is also some controversy with the actual programming of this work. Normally in my school, when someone wins the concerto competition, they get the opportunity to show off the piece they played at the annual concert in April/May (where we will be presenting the Fantasy). However, this time the concerto winner has been asked to play the Fantasy instead. She won with the first Chopin Piano Concerto, and an argument has been presented to me that the Chopin concerto is “difficult to program”. Let’s look at this more closely.

<div class="header">Scoring and programming</div>

The Chopin Piano Concerto is scored for the usual string and woodwinds, four horns, two trumpets, one (!) trombone, timpani, and of course the piano.

The Beethoven Choral Fantasy is scored for the same string and woodwinds, two trumpets, timpani, four-part choir and of course, the piano.

The parts are extremely similar, bar the trombone and the choir. When it comes to instrumentation, these pieces can be quite easily swapped. The Choral Fantasy uses slightly less players in the brass section, but this could easily be made up for with the other pieces on the program (which we will look at later). Also, the concerto doesn’t require a choir, and would fit much better to VCH’s ridiculous regulation on how many people can be on stage at once (don’t get me started on that!)

What about how the music fits into the program? The program currently looks like this (concert order):

Debussy: <i>prelude a l'apres-midi d'un faune</i>

Beethoven: <i>Choral Fantasy</i>

Brahms: <i>Symphony No.2 in D Major</i>

This program is pretty standard stuff, I don’t think there’s anything particularly revolutionary about it. If the Chopin concerto was put in the second spot (where it would be fit in standard concert order), then a choral piece would have to be chosen to replace the Brahms.  The concert would be slightly longer, and I would suggest that a 30-40 minute choral work would be perfect to replace the Brahms and keep the concert a similar length. The Faure <i>Requiem</i> comes to mind as a possibility here, a stepping stone between the romantic music of Chopin and also the French impressionism of Debussy. I present this hypothetical concert order:

Debussy: <i>prelude a l'apres-midi d'un faune</i>

Chopin: <i>Piano Concerto in E minor</i>

Faure: <i>Requiem in D minor</i>

This is just a simple example off the top of my head, there are several pieces that I know and hundreds that I don’t that would be a good fit for this last spot. This piece would have two functions: it would involve more orchestra members that perhaps missed a chance to play in the Fantasy, and it would fully show off NAFA’s choir as a unit of capable musicians that can actually sing more than a three minute passage. Maybe then we could use more of our rehearsal time to engage with the music, rather than to listen to stories and be let off an hour early every week (another gripe of mine).

<div class="header">Soloists</div>

Like most choral works, the Choral Fantasy also involves a quartet of solo singers. A decision has been made to have the vocal majors in my school sing this part in <i>groups</i>. I think that this is one of the most hypocritical decisions that could have been made, considering the importance that our conductor and school has placed on being absolutely religious in following the score. Despite this, apparently it’s okay for a part marked “Soli” by the composer’s hand to be sung by a group. For me, this is as ridiculous as asking the oboe to play a fifth down to replace a cor anglais, or the flute to play an octave up to substitute the piccolo. If we are doing this, we might as well reduce the string sections to just violins and cello.

I understand that sometimes concessions have to be made like this in order to perform a work. We can’t necessarily build a hammer for every production of Mahler’s Sixth. Money and time are unfortunately a real concern even for artists. However, in every choral production I’ve been a part of, NAFA has always been able to provide soloists. Bear in mind this concert will not be free, and if I paid 15 or 25 dollars for a ticket and didn’t get soloists when there should be, I would be furious.

However, instead of just complaining about the problem, let me look at why I think this decision has been made. I have contacted my conductor with no reply, so I guess I’ll be taking a stab in the dark here. If we discount the reason of money, I can think of two possibilities.

<b>1. The voice majors of NAFA need extra exposure, and getting them to sing the solo parts will be good for their growth as a musician.</b>

To me, this doesn’t make any sense at all. The voice majors will already be singing the choral parts, and if they are singing the solo parts as a group, that makes it a choral part too (LOL). They simply won’t get the valuable experience of singing alone. Forcing them to learn the parts might be good for their growth, but any responsible singer in a choir would already do that on their own.

<b>2. The voice faculty of NAFA deserves recognition in the big annual concert.</b>

This is a decent argument, the orchestral faculties will already be shown off in the concert in general, and the piano faculty will be given a nod with the solo piano part of the Choral Fantasy. Normally when the voice faculty is hidden within a choir, they only get the general appreciation of the audience. For me personally, I don’t think this is so important. The audience most likely thinks the choir is full of voice majors anyway, and bringing a subset of the choir to the audience’s attention will most likely confuse them. I’d argue a quartet of singers from NAFA’s voice faculty (or even students!) would be a better way to show the capabilities of our vocal department.

This concert is going to be played on the 11th of April, and it’s meant to be an exhibition of our faculties and musicianship. Instead, the planning and rehearsals have been closer to an exhibition of our incompetence and lack of artistic integrity. I can only assume the concert will end up in the same vein. I’ll be performing of course, but I’d encourage everyone to take my school’s advice: Stay at home and save your money, music isn’t worth it.
