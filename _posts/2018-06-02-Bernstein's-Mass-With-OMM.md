It’s been a rather disappointing concert season in Singapore recently. I’ve been to way too many mediocre (sometimes downright awful) concerts by various local orchestras in the past two or three months, and I was glad for something new with OMM (Orchestra of the Music Makers) tackling the massive Bernstein Mass. This is an undertaking that I do not believe any other orchestra in Singapore would attempt, and miraculously they were not just successful, they were often magnificent.

This magnificence stemmed from the brilliant casting of the main character, the Celebrant. Kevin Vortmann specialises in Bernstein’s oeuvre, having performed as Tony in West Side Story as well as the Celebrant worldwide. His experience clearly shows; his character is the most well-sung and by far the most well-acted. He was so charismatic that they even let him do the announcements before the show instead of the usual automated voice; the audience was in love with him before the first note. 

Unfortunately automation somehow made its way into the actual performance, with several parts being played via recording rather than live music-making. I believe this is due to a lack of instruments and players; these parts were especially unfortunate in the <i>Credo</i> where I felt they broke up the pacing of the work quite severely. It didn’t help that orchestra, choir, and soloists alike didn’t really seem to know what to do during these recordings and simply stood around in darkness.

Thankfully when the music was live the stage presence and direction of the musicians is some of the best I have ever seen. This is likely the only good staging of a work I have ever seen in Singapore. Apart from some pretty lame slides of people praying during the orchestral interludes, the entire experience was incredibly immersive, much like watching a good movie. The camerawork was wonderful, I don’t know how they got so many effective shots of the orchestra and soloists; it was like watching a well edited video on YouTube at times. It was also a fun surprise to see the choir and orchestra take part in some of the acting and choreography together with the soloists. Together with just a few props, this was enough to be completely absorbed in the story of the Celebrant, who slowly loses his sanity as he realises his own lack of faith in God. This descent into madness was well-matched by both the orchestra and the choir who seemed to channel the energy of the Celebrant into their own performances. It is clear that every effort was made to make this seem as much as possible like a real church service, and the sheer levels of immersion in the music-making was for me the greatest success of the night.

However, when the choirs and orchestras were on their own they had some hiccups. I felt that generally the projection of the choir was lacking, and I could tell their energy was flagging through the longer movements. There’s a sense of amateurity here; however there was also plenty of heart and the choirs did give it their all when it mattered, particularly towards the end in the <i>Die Profundis</i> and <i>Dona Nobis Pacem</i>. The Dona Nobis Pacem was especially filled with energy, it felt like the roof was going to come down from the combined effort of the musicians. This was the highlight of the night for me as far as the choir goes, although their prayerful <i>Almighty Father</i> was a close second and showed their wide musical capabilities in spite of some technical weakness.


The final communion after this fell short; especially as it followed an incredible scene where we see the Celebrant finally lose it and break the communion glass (the dramatic climax of the work). It’s introduction was very awkwardly handled; as the principal flute seemed very uncomfortable playing while walking down stairs in high heels and a gown. The bitonality in this movement (?) was also rather shaky and much of the music seemed to be on a tightrope and ready to collapse at any moment. Despite this, the combined effort of the choir and soloists coming into the music seemed to steady the ship enough for an almost transcendental intoning of “Amen” to end the night. The audience was surprisingly well behaved here, holding their applause for a laudable amount of time. I actually got chills from the silence at the end.

Many of the instrumentalists also seemed to be out of their comfort zone throughout the night, particularly in the lesser-seen instruments such as the organ and guitar. This led to a lack of conviction in many of the orchestral interludes, most of which were far too timid for my taste. Mishaps like this are to be expected of such a postmodern work, and the strings and lower woodwinds should be commended for near-perfect execution throughout the night. Clarinets were particularly impressive, with solid tone and genuine musicality.

Despite its flaws, everyone involved in the creation of this production should be very proud of themselves, they have done something very special tonight. I didn’t think Singapore was ready for such a big modern work and they have proved me wrong. OMM has accomplished something as a semi-professional orchestra that I don’t think professional orchestras in Singapore could match. I’ll definitely be buying tickets for the next OMM concert: that’s a pact, shake on that, no taking back.

P.S. This concert had the cutest programme booklet ever. Props to whoever designed that.
