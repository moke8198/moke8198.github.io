The Schumann symphonies are perhaps the most neglected works of the Romantic period. Considered second-rate to the Brahms symphonies, Schumann’s symphonic material has long lived in the shadow of the music of his greatest student. Thankfully, lately there has been a resurgence in the popularity of these four great symphonies, with many young composers taking up their batons to record these enigmatic works. Full of quirks and orchestral “mishaps”, it’s easy to see why these works remained largely unperformed for the better part of the 20th century. The melodies aren’t clearly outlined and often the Schumann’s direction is rather sparse for works of this period. To perform them successfully requires a great deal of <i>effort</i>.

However, this effort is not without its rewards. Beyond some absolutely brilliant musical material, these four symphonies provide an insight into the shattered psyche of one of history’s most tortured musicians. Born to be a world-famous virtuoso, he injured his hand irreparably and took to composition instead. While his early works such as the <i>Papillons</i>(Op.2) and <i>Kinderszenen</i>(Op.16) are filled with joy and youthful optimism, many of his later works have a dark, depressed character to them. Listening to his violin sonatas and choral works, the signs of the insanity that would end his life are quite clear. No wonder this music is especially rarely played, it is difficult to understand with awkward rhythms, broken melodies and ambiguous form. People argue to this day whether these works have any value; are they masterpieces or just rubbish coming out from a not-quite-there mind? Perhaps somehow they are both, and we will look further into this as I compare the two versions of his <i>Fourth Symphony</i>, Op.120.

The Schumann symphonies are confusing in more than one sense: they are not numbered chronologically. The fourth symphony is actually the second to be written, first finished in 1841. It is the fourth simply because it was the last to be published; a revised version was released to the public a decade later in 1851. 1851 is only three short years before Schumann would lose his mind and essentially his life. By this time he was already plagued by his demons, and his insanity reveals itself in similar works from this period such as the Drei Phantasiestücke</i> (op.111) written just a few months prior.

<div class="captions">Notice how the phrases here seem rather stunted, and not very Romantic at all</div>

Comparing the two versions of this symphony (just the first movement, I need time to live my life also), I hope to more conclusively show the effects of his degenerating mental health.

<div class="header">A Decade of Despair</div>

What happened in between these 10 years? Schumann, who had finally won the battle for the right to be married to his beloved wife Clara, had to suddenly contend with the death of one of his children at only a year old. After his marriage, he also started to move away from writing for the piano (perhaps he thought that was Clara’s domain now) and instead began an outpouring of works for the voice. In 1840 he wrote more than 130 songs, and as he matured as a composer he began to work with darker texts; particularly the obsession with Faust that seems to plague so many romantic composers. It’s impossible for me to pinpoint exactly what caused his mental health to fail, but I think working with such a dark text cannot possibly have helped him. This Faustian fixation led to one of the most morbid works of the 18th century, the <i>Scenes from Goethe's Faust</i> which he started on as early as 1842. Here’s a little taste of it below:

<div class="captions">Schumann himself considered this overture to be one of his best works</div>

In 1848 his life was shaken up once again by the May Uprising in Dresden, a revolution that forced him to vacate his city which eventually would lead him to take up position as conductor in Dusseldorf. Here he was driven out of his job by his contemporaries; Schonberg (some musicologist/journalist) states: "The great composer was impossible on the platform ... There is something heartrending about poor Schumann's epochal inefficiency as a conductor." With all of the struggles in his life, it’s no surprise that the 1851 edition starts on a sustained, open A natural:

As compared to the 1841 which starts staccato on the much more common major V (the traditional dominant <i>chord</i>):

(normally I would put the full score here, but it takes up too much space on the page. For those interested here are the links of the two scores I used for pictures. I’ll be putting most of the important excerpts up anyway.

Also here are recordings of the two different versions:

The differences in the opening don’t stop with just tonality and harmony, when we look to the full score we see that the 1851 is much more heavily orchestrated. Of particular significance is this sinister timpani trill beginning in the very first bar:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/schumann3.png" alt="">

In comparison, the 1841 version has just a simple, staccato strike:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/schumann4.png" alt="">

This trill imbues this opening chord with an intense sense of uneasiness, perhaps even desperation. Trills in the low registers are often used by the Romantic masters to create a dark colour like this; the most famous of which is surely the low trill on F natural in the late Schubert B-flat sonata finished roughly 20 years prior in 1828:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/schumann5.png" alt="">

There are yet more differences to be uncovered; it’s not just the timpani part that has been augmented. The upper winds have also been given longer notes to be held over the first motif whispered by the violin and doubled by bassoon:

<div class="captions">1851 winds, opening 3 bars</div>

This suspension of the dominant over the original chord once again complicates matters; the harmony is more ambiguous and there are opportunities to form dissonances with notes such as the G in the bassoon part above. By pushing the suspension from the middle register of the clarinet (1841) to the upper registers of the flute and oboe (1851) Schumann has deliberately brought this dissonance closer to the listener’s ears. The doubled oboe in particular forms quite a noticeable dissonance with the first violins, being the most penetrating of the wind instruments. From just the first four bars, we can glimpse Schumann’s mindset after 10 tragic years.

<div class="header">Treatment of the Symphonic Form</div> 

In the mid-1800s, the world was obsessed with the Beethoven symphonies. Considered then and possibly even still today as the greatest set of symphonies ever written, they were the gold standard of what a composer should try and achieve with an orchestra. Standing alongside them were the incredible 41 Mozart symphonies; these classical symphonies were considered a triumph particularly in the art of form. In Beethoven and Mozart, the themes and motifs seem to so effortlessly flow from each other and yet somehow fit together in an intricate, usually mathematical form. This is the beauty of the classical symphony.

In Beethoven and Mozart, the themes and motifs seem to so effortlessly flow from each other and yet somehow fit together in an intricate, usually mathematical form. This is the beauty of the classical symphony.

I believe Schumann (especially in his earlier years) strived very much to be like the great classical composers in his symphonic writing, evidence of this can be seen in his Third symphony which shares an opening theme much like the Eroica:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/schumann8.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">Opening of the Third Symphony, winds and brass form an E flat chord on this melody by first violin. </div>

And the wonderful, galloping melodies of his First Symphony that seem to be homage to the Scherzos of Mozart and Haydn:

<div class="captions">First Symphony, Op. 34. First theme of the first movement.</div>

The Fourth also features some of these aspects in its melodic and harmonic language; however where it truly differs from the classical symphonies is in the idea of form. The 1851 sees all for movements taken attacca, while in the 1841 the first movement is still distinct from the second (perhaps inspired by Beethoven’s Sixth). When Schumann decided to transform this symphony into half an hour of continuous music, he also reworked the introduction of the Fourth to transition more directly into its main sonata-form first theme. This is one of the biggest changes to the symphony (almost 2 pages are entirely different) and whether it is truly more impactful is an impossible discussion. However, we can guess at Schumann’s intention behind the change.

The 1851 is much more terse; the slow, haunting whisper of the introduction we looked at before suddenly gets picked up in a section marked <i>stringendo</i>, and then the first violins burst into quick repeated notes and descend suddenly into D minor. This technique of repeating notes in the strings (tremolo) is commonly used by all composers to add an extra intensity due to the repeated bowing:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/schumann10.png" alt="">

In comparison, the 1841 has a much longer, more drawn out transition as the key is carefully changed from A major to D minor. This leads to a slower, much less intense transition that is played out through a rather simple chromatic figure. It’s still exciting, but I think it’s much more measured. Once the chromatic figure starts you know where it’s going; it doesn’t have the wild feeling of the 1851:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/schumann11.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">This transition takes place after almost a page of development has pushed the harmony towards the A7 chord</div>

The difference between the first violins is especially marked; the 1841 version has them keeping a pedal point on the note G, while the 1851 version has them actually take the melodic brunt of the transition with a furious descending scale. In the 1841, the dominant seventh is formed with the other parts, namely the second violin, first oboe, brass and timpani (highest to lowest respectively). These notes are all suspended over the chromatic scale in the lower strings to lead us to D minor. In the 1851, the transition is much more direct; Schumann seems to throw tradition to the wind and has only a few short staccato dominant chords play behind the first violins. Gone is the careful modulation, instead it is replaced by a sense of immediacy. He wants to be in this key and so he just goes there directly; this will be a technique used by so many composers in the future: Tchaikovsky, Mahler and Bruckner all have this firmly in their repertoire. 

<div class="header">A Loss of Clarity</div> 

Perhaps mirroring the fading sharpness of his mind, the 1851 is plagued with the so-called “hopeless orchestration” of Schumann. Many of his critics have stated that his music is so thick that melody and accompaniment cannot be easily distinguished, particularly in his symphonic writing. Schumann’s string writing has also been accused of being too “notey” and exhausting for musicians; we examples of both of these things in the 1851 main theme:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/schumann13.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">1851 strings: main theme</div>

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/schumann12.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">1841 strings: main theme</div>

Comparing it to the 1841, we see all parts except the first violin are much more decorated and filled with more notes. Even the double bass isn’t spared here; it has semiquaver figures that are atypical of its usual function in a classical symphony (providing harmonic stability). The simple, almost Mozartian syncopated accompaniment of the 1841 has been replaced with music that is full of accents and articulation. In particular, the second violin accompanies the first by harmonising in the rather strange interval of a <i>fourth</i>. The fourth is traditionally a dissonant interval, and this provides a rarely heard dark and mysterious colour in the symphonic repertoire. This heightened texture and unconventional harmonisation makes it very difficult to discern what goes on under the melody, shading the music with an uncomfortable uncertainty.

Beyond string writing, we also see an extended use of the winds and brass in the 1851 version of the Fourth. Perhaps responding to criticism that his symphonic music was too grounded in writing for the first violin, the 1851 Fourth has a lot of notes in the woodwinds and brass that simply don’t exist in the 1841. The beginning of the development in the 1851 looks like this:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/schumann14.png" alt="">

While the corresponding section in the 1841 looks like this:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/schumann15.png" alt="">

Not only is the second theme (Eb-F-Gb-Db-C) taken up and developed by every single wind instrument in the 1851, the lower winds also slowly begin to add dissonance and colour with the use of suspensions.  These suspensions are slowly added one by one after the main theme in a bit of writing that can almost be considered <i>fugato</i?. This idea of suspension is of course carried over from the suspended notes we heard in the introduction. This is an added element to the music that is perhaps not so obvious on first listening, but instead muddies our attention away from the main theme to something else, something a bit more ethereal and harder to grasp. I personally think this moment in the development of the 1851 is quite special compared to what we have in the 1841, even as it pushes traditional counterpoint rules.

Beyond the slightly more innovative writing, the woodwind parts are also all doubled to provide more sound. The balance of sound between winds and strings is surprisingly important even in doubling; it’s one of the key differences between the classical and romantic symphonies. Upon listening to the two versions of this symphony, I think that the string’s melodies in the 1841 are enhanced by the doubling in oboe and bassoon. The winds are quite imperceptible in this section, they merely add an extra dimension to the strings playing. In the 1851, the winds are close to overtaking the strings. It’s like the two sections are battling for dominance over this melody and they create a sound that is perhaps more “orchestral”, with less of a distinct timbre. It’s quite easy to imagine how the 1851 symphony has a much bigger sound that is perhaps closer to Mahler than Mozart, perhaps a prediction of the modern orchestra that was beyond Schumann’s experience.

However, the most famous example of Schumann’s manipulation of timbre in this symphony must surely be the “horn” call that begins the development. This call is an E flat in the bass trombone that is doubled by other instruments to increase the scope and impact of this bold Neapolitan modulation. In the 1841, this E flat is doubled only by bassoon and clarinet:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/schumann16.png" alt="">

Whereas in the 1851 it is taken by almost the entire orchestra except the winds, which means there’s no way I can put a picture of it here. Interestingly, the mix of lower woodwinds and bass trombone in the 1841 actually lends an almost muted quality to this call. In fact, the tone would likely be much more penetrating if only the trombone was playing. This seems to be a far more quiet and doubtful step into this foreign tonal centre. In the 1851, this note is incredibly loud and piercing with the full force of the string and brass sections; which have a very complimentary timbre when it comes to projection. It is like a sign that something monumental has happened, and Schumann is definitely not the slightest bit unsure about this bold stride into a new key. Similar to the introduction, he’s no longer afraid of pushing the boundaries of acceptable modulation (at least for the nineteenth century sonata-form movements).

<div class="header">Inspiration through Insanity</div> 

We notice that in all these examples, it’s usually not as simple as Schumann just adding more instruments to double a part. He genuinely adds new articulations, new harmonic material and even fresh counterpoint and revised form. These decisions have had a massive effect on the music, despite it still having the same overarching themes and ideas. Many of these innovations are well ahead of his time, and don’t make sense from a Classical viewpoint. Perhaps many of them still do not make sense today, but Schumann’s music can be enjoyed even with its flaws, simply because the raw nature of his writing is so powerful.

When comparing the 1851 symphony to those of Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert (and of course his own 1841 symphony), I believe there is an extra element lent to it by his impending madness. Just as Beethoven arguably produced his most transcendental music while deaf, I believe Schumann’s mental illness has paradoxically created some incredible pieces of art. While not technically perfect, there is something special about these late works that sets them apart from the rest of the Romantic oeuvre. <b>Music that is difficult to play and understand isn’t necessarily bad.</b> I believe this is a big reason for the Schumann revival in the recent decades, and I hope one day he will be deservedly mentioned in the same breath as Brahms and Beethoven.
