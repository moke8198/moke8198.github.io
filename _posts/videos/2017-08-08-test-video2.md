description: "The greatest concerto ever written. The violin is my favourite instrument, its timbre is so expressive and close to the human soul. I only wish the piano could produce such a singing and sustained tone. Even when it is in its lively third movement, the tragedy of the two movements before still haunts me. Is there another composer who could express sorrow as vividly as Brahms?"
