description: "One of my favourite Mozart works. I only recently discovered the origin of the famous <i>Laudate Dominum</i>, the fifth movement here. My favourite movement is actually the last, the joyful <i>Magnificat</i>, where Mozart uses the perfect fifth interval and a <i>subito piano</i> marking to great effect. The recording here is rather historically accurate, which I think is appropriate for this work where the style of writing does not call for a big choir or orchestra."
