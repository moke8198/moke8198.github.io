I have a problem with contemporary "classical" music. The phrase is an oxymoron, but what I refer to is music written by composers who have studied extensively the works of the distant past. This is the difference between pop music, and the contemporary music I heard tonight at the tenth anniversary concert of the Composers Society of Singapore (CSS). However, unlike pop music which is written for the masses, this contemporary music is often avant garde and hard to understand.

My main problem with contemporary music is that I often find that it abandons what is nice to attempt to shock and surprise. To me, there is nothing more natural than a dominant chord leading to a tonic. This is a release as natural to humans as breathing in and then breathing out. Thus, I do not believe modern composers are closer to grasping the human psyche with their music, which is an argument I've heard for it's "weirdness". I think we lost a lot when composers stopped composing for the public, which is what most music was all the way up to the 20th century. It wasn’t classical music, it was simply popular music enjoyed by everyone at the time. Now there is this distinction between popular music and classical music, which I detest.

Secondly, I do not believe that music made for any reason other than to please the ears and mind is valid. Music can inspire all kinds of emotions, but I don't care if a piece makes an impression on me if that impression is a bad one. The emotional output of the music must be overall positive for me to want to listen to it again. There is music such as the opening chorus of Mozart's <i>Requiem</i>, which is pure sorrow in the form of sound. Yet, I love to listen to it even though it evokes the negative feeling of sadness in me. This is because although it is sad, it's melodies and harmonies are so beautifully placed that the overall experience is a positive one. Unfortunately with contemporary music, often listeners are made to feel uncomfortable or anxious, with no payoff in the music except those negative emotions.

I have immense respect for every serious composer, as fellow musicians they inspire me. However I cannot always agree with their intentions, and I won't mince words in this review. I hope that my criticism only reinforces the pieces that I thought were good; saying everything is good merely cheapens my opinion. Criticism against these pieces is not a criticism of the composer, just my reaction to the piece with my level of musical understanding. I am no expert, but as an avid appreciator of music I think these criticisms are valid. These are my raw reactions to the music, written seconds after hearing them. I have had an hour or so to edit it if I thought necessary. The writing is not refined nor scholarly, but it is honest, and I stand by everything I have written.

The theme of this concert was a collection of short piano pieces, 32 in all. Each was to last about a minute. I thought it was strange that as a 10 year celebration of composition in Singapore, everyone is still writing for the piano. I would have preferred a more varied program that could really showcase the versatility of the composers.

However, there might have been a very good reason to programme the concert this way: The pianist was simply spectacular. Mortz is one of the most fantastic pianists I have had the opportunity to see live. He has formidable technique, and more importantly seems to have an innate sense of how his music sounds from the perspective of the audience. This is a vital skill to cultivate in all performers. I would gladly pay to watch him in a concert of more conventional music. However, the focus of the concert was the composers, so here we will be reviewing every single one of those roughly one minute pieces in a little more than one sentence. If it ends with a +, it means I would like to hear it again, which is the highest praise I can give any music.

<div class="header">The Music</div>

Festive Overture, Yvonne Teng Woei: Largely tonal, but quite boring with little difference of texture or color. Seemed more like a piece to open the concert rather than a serious composition. 


Prelude for CSS 10th Anniversary!, Ching Shih Hoh: Colourful, but lacking creativity. Got worse and worse as it dragged on for 55 seconds too long.


flowers in every footstep, Bertram Wee: Nice at first. Full of color and fragmented melodies. Fell apart halfway to a lot of noise that didn’t make sense to me.


My Desktop III. Crying Clips, Chee Kong Ho: Tonal. Kind of like a discount Chopin nocturne. Had some really nice water-like impressionistic moments too.+


Oblivion, Jonelle Lim: One of the more interesting pieces. Seemed to tread on the edge of tonality. Hard to say if I like it or not, which to me is a plus. Managed to keep my attention to the end, and was probably the most original piece of the night.+


Und dann, Diana Soh: Really poor. Made no sense to me whatsoever. At times felt like random notes, but sometimes there were also clearly deliberate harmonies that did not sound good.


A Moment of Singapore, Dieter Mack: First good use of the prepared piano. Was fairly interesting at first, but after a while I got bored as it all began to sound the same. Ends with a bang for  no discernible reason except to shock. Did not get any idea of Singapore in the piece.


Happy 10th Anniversary for CSS, Kee Yong Chong: Basically only inside playing.This is what I imagine cleaning a piano sounds like. I would not let anyone play this on my piano. Ernst sang a couple of notes during this. On top of being a great pianists, he has a pretty good voice.


Sixty Seconds, Kim Ngoc: There was a ticking noise during this, like a metronome. Added nothing to the music, except literally making it last a minute. Was it added just to make it sound different from other contemporary music?


A short piece for pianoforte No.6, Michael Asmara: A lot of noise and pianistic bluster, but quite bearable. Like if two symphonies were layered and then transcribed to piano, and the performer was then told to play wrong notes half the time.


a postieriori, Jonas Baes: Another really poor piece in my opinion. A lot of random sounding notes interspersed with silence. The silence was the best part. Suddenly turned into a super tonal and honestly beautiful piece, which made me think I had missed something.


Hinterland, Vivienne Tan: Quite nice. Had an impressionistic feel to it. Definitely felt like it could be representing Hinterland, whatever that is. It sounded like a far away epic place.


Syonanto-The Sook Ching Massacre, Kangyi Zhang: Nice use of repeated notes. I felt this piece was really expressive even though it wasn't tonal in the slightest, and quite bangy. Eye opening, however I don't think it would have the same effect a second time, and I'm not interested to hear it again.


Oneirica II, Jun An Chew: Very noisy. This might have been the most abstract and tough to understand music of the night.

decca- ,Lee Ji Heng: One of the few pieces with a recognisable theme, and a rather haunting melody fragment. Got a bit noisy in the middle but I felt that in this case it was exciting, rather than pointless.. +


Frozen Motion, Jon Lin Chua: This music was genuinely scary, I can best describe it as similar to the way the Wolf from the Red Riding Hood etude sounds. At first I wasn't impressed, but the haunting notes at the end really tie the image together. +


Eine Schone Zeit war Es, Jiradej Setabundhu: I did not like this piece. Sounded like a kid had his first lesson in intervals and was desperate to find which one sounded worst.


Prelude 10, Gu Wei :One of the more colourful pieces of the night, using both the lower and upper registers to good effect. Despite this, I felt something was missing, and have no desire to listen to it again.


Dangerous Game, Daniel Lim: Another piece that didn't make much sense to me. It had some colours, but most of it seemed lost in the sheer amount of notes. I was very impressed by the Ernst’s technique to be able to pull this off. No doubt I would have hated it if played by a lesser pianist, but in the end it was not bad.


Edenkobener Extra, Per Magnus Lindborg: This piece somehow reminded me of Shostakovich. Quite nice. Knew when to end as well, which cannot be said of many of the pieces tonight.


Music with Purpose No.1, Anothai Nitibhon: Literally cleaning the piano. ROFL. I really liked how the performer paused for applause after this masterpiece.


Noisette, Joyce Bee Tuan Koh: My history teacher's piece! Naturally the best of the evening. Honestly though, it was very colourful, but after a while I was bored.


“Minute(ish)-ature” for Piano, Christopher Johann Clarke: Another colourful piece, I think this was more interesting than the last, if a bit noisy. yet the noise seemed convincing. +


reitario, Emily Koh: One of two pieces I could envision playing (for money). Had a simple idea, and sounded pretty good. +


Moments in a Blurred City, Avik Chari: This piece was really nice. A few colours used very well, and a lovely melody as well. My favourite of the night, and another I could imagine playing, even for free!+++


antece-dented, Rachel Leia Devadason: This one was really weird. Started like pop music, then turned into a mess of dissonance. It was interesting though, and used the percussive effect of hitting the piano well. The ending was the only perfect cadence I heard the entire night since the first piece.


Resonance Study, Denise Lee: Made very little sense. There was about as much music in this as when he cleaned the piano, and it was a lot less funny.


Phosphorous, Eric Watson: More fascinating than pleasant. Had a lot of interesting textures, but unfortunately didn't really sound nice overall.


Wind, Kongmeng Liew: I could feel the impressionistic qualities in the music quite well. However, there was almost no surprise or interest in the music. 


RipPed feAtheRs, Darren Sng: These feathers are certainly ripped. Sounded like a getting hit by a truck, plane, and rocketship at the same time. Had a quiet ending, but that wasn't nice either.


Timang Burung, Yii Kah Hoe: Had quite a few colours, and remained interesting throughout. Nothing very special, but it was nice. Not enough to warrant a second hearing.


Sonatina, Joseph Lim: Unfortunately a lacklustre ending. Very noisy and the eventual melody is almost but not quite nice, as if there are deliberate wrong notes written in. However at least it was very varied in its texture.


There were a few pieces in this concert that surprised me, and there is some promise for the composing scene in Singapore. I found one or two rare atonal pieces that I could appreciate, and for every weak piece there was a strong one. However, can the music in this concert be compared to Mozart's or Brahms? For me, that would be like comparing a fast food joint and a Michelin star restaurant. There's a reason so few composers are remembered, while countless have been lost to time. I only hope that soon Singapore will create such a composer, who continues to inspire 200 years from now.
