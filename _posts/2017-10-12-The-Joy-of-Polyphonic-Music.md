A few days ago, I had a couple of friends over at my place and they wanted to hear me play something on the piano. They aren’t musicians, but they probably listen to pop music on a regular basis. Ever ready to please, I naturally reached for the Well-Tempered Clavier and played them my favourite fugue. Through four distinct subjects, several <i>stretto</i>, and the marked increase in tension with every false entry, my friends sat listening quietly, frankly probably close to dozing off. Upon finishing, one of them commented: “It’s just the same melody over and over!” And yes, while a fugue at its heart is just the same few subjects over and over, the brilliance of polyphonic writing is the setting of this melody (or subjects) as well as its transformation.

Among his many crowning achievements, Bach has written something special for keyboardists. The two books of the Well-Tempered Clavier (WTC) should be on the shelf of every pianist, and they are both wonderful music and a successful experiment. After the acceptance of equal temperament on keyboard instruments, composers were eager to write pieces in every key, now that every key mathematically sounded the same, albeit with different colours. The first book of the WTC is the first ever compilation of a set of 24 piece in every key. They rise chromatically from C Major to B minor, a prelude and fugue for every set. Bach did this to prove a point: that it was possible to write good music in every key, and that frequent modulations and dissonances in a piece could be successful. In this respect, he saved his most masterful composition for last, the B minor fugue of WTC 1, BWV 869. This is the fugue that bored my friends, but hopefully I can explain why it certainly doesn’t bore me.

<div class="header">The Final Fugue</div>

There are many creative passages in this fugue, however structurally it follows the formula of any other Baroque fugue. There are three obvious things of note; the first subject, countersubject, and a recurring episode of music that holds the music together (think of it as a sauce that ties a dish of food together). However, the way this music is intertwined with false starts, <i>stretto</i> and all kinds of polyphonic techniques is what makes this fugue in my opinion the most challenging of the entire book, both technically and especially musically. Of course, each of these three individual components of the music is special as well, and the entire thing can be difficult to understand. I’ll break the music first into its basic elements, before looking at it together. Before that, here’s a recording of the work:

Immediately, most people will be shocked at how dissonant the entire thing is. Especially if the long notes are played with trill, the whole thing can sound jarring and even quite modern. The entire piece is sombre and full of pain, even in the short releases of the relative major, and the key is often ambiguous and requires a fast mind to place. It is also very long, it’s six pages of music compared to the usual two, and it’s slow music at that. The key is shared with the famous B Minor Mass, and this colour that is so dark compared to the light of C Major is apparent straight away from the subject of the fugue. It’s incredible that a single melody line can hold so much colour, but this is no ordinary subject.

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/fugue1.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">Subject of the fugue. Articulation has been left out for clarity</div>

All twelve tones are used here! It could almost be considered a Schoenberg tone row, except unfortunately some of the tones are repeated. Imagine the repercussions if there were no repeated notes in this subject; musicologists would be having a field day with this subject! Here, there’s a reason for the repeated notes. If we use Schoenberg’s philosophy, the reason a tone row has no repeated notes is that all twelve tones are equal. Hence, we can find the tones that Bach considers to be more important in this piece: they are the repeated notes in the subject. There are twenty notes in this subject, and the following notes are repeated: D natural, two times; B natural, three times; F sharp, four times; C sharp, twice. 
The tonality of the piece is hence clearly laid out, despite the several chromatic notes. The B minor triad is in those notes, B D F#, yet it is interesting that the F# is the most often repeated note at four times. F# is of course the dominant, and this is further emphasised by the repeat of C# twice. However the key A# here is missing, and A natural isn’t present twice as well. I think this is deliberate, as we zoom out and look at the bigger picture. 

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/fugue2.png" alt="">

However, this isn’t just a showcase of equal temperament; Bach also used this as an excuse to exercise his creative genius to design a fugue around a subject of such complexity. If we assume that the book was composed in order from C Major to B minor (although there is no proof of this that I could find), then we can note that previously Bach has written a theme rather similar to this one, in his F minor fugue from WTC 1, BWV 857.

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/fugue3.png" alt="">

There are actually a lot of similarities between these two fugues beyond their subjects; as seen above the F minor fugue has a subject that is comprised almost entirely of semitones. They are also both three-bar phrases, unlike the more common two-bar subjects Bach employed in most of the fugues of this first book. The F minor fugue is the twelfth in the series, while the B minor is the twenty fourth, the midpoint and end of the book. That’s frankly unlikely to be of significance and is likely a coincidence, but you can never tell when the genius of Bach is involved. I’ll be bringing up a lot of these little details as we go through the fugue, and it’s up to the discretion of the musician on whether he wants to see them as deliberate or not. I think that sometimes we tend to overthink things when it comes to looking at music, but it’s also important to keep our bases covered when doing analysis.

<div class="header">The countersubject</div>

The countersubject of this fugue runs into a big problem: it is very difficult for Bach to put running semiquavers under the subject, as it will most likely lead to very ugly writing with several awkward leaps in order to avoid an unbearable dissonance. Hence, he has opted for a simpler countersubject; just eight semiquavers, meant to be played against the final long minim of the subject:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/fugue4.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">The short, unresolved countersubject </div>

This is the reason I am against trilling most of these minims, as it destroys the beauty of the countersubject by obscuring it in a blur of dissonance. I personally only play the trills when there is nothing beneath them, such as in the first presentation of the subject. After all, a modern piano has no problem sustaining the sound of the minim if the fugue is taken at a reasonable tempo, so the trill’s traditional function of sustaining notes is redundant. Choice of instrument is important: <b>let’s not play harpsichord ornaments on a modern piano.</b>

A string of eight semiquavers can be found frequently throughout any fugue; so it’s important to find a key characteristic to “hook” on to and define our countersubject. I think this is in the last two notes, above it is the semitone between B and A#. Every time we see this countersubject reprised, the first six notes are often subject to change, but the last two notes are almost always a descending semitone (rarely a tone, nothing is perfect), which allows for an interesting resolution of the countersubject we will look at later.
  
<div class="header">A “hidden” Countersubject</div>

Unfortunately, there are still further complications with the countersubject. Put simply: there is most likely another one! Perhaps the more observant readers will realise that the previous countersubject I brought up only occurs in bar 5, whereas a traditional countersubject should begin immediately after the first subject, i.e. in bar 4. In bar 4 we find <i>another</i> line of 8 semiquavers that at first looks to be distinct from the rest of the music and never repeated. The confusion really starts when we realise it isn’t actually distinct, and we look at how it is transformed.

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/fugue5.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">Another countersubject in bar 4?</div>

When this “hidden” countersubject is reprised, it is almost never in its original form, hence my choice of name; it is truly hidden deep beneath many layers. Most simply, it is fragmented, and only the first four notes of this subject are used as brief interludes in the inner voices. More deviously however, this subject is often inverted! Every interval is reversed, so what was previously an ascending interval becomes the equivalent descending interval. The first example of this inversion is in bar 9:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/fugue6.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">There’s a problem with this inversion however! It’ll resolve itself later I promise </div>

This countersubject is more important than it seems, and I’ll spend a lot of time on it when we look at the actual music.

<div class="header">A New Episode</div>

There is one more theme in this fugue that can be identified, it is an “episodic” section, one that is used to provide a break from the subject and countersubject. This episode appears thrice, or six times depending on your point of view, since whenever it is introduced it is immediately repeated. It is defined by this descending sequence, and it’s most charming aspect is certainly its rhythm:

img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/fugue7.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">I think the semiquaver-quaver rhythm here is really cute</div>

Thankfully, there’s not much to be said about this episode without looking at how it works together with the other two (three?) subjects. Let’s dive right into that then, it’s quite the adventure.

<div class="header">The Art of This Fugue </div>

When we look at the fugue as a whole, I will be using the following terms for brevity:

S-Subject

CS-Countersubject

HS-Hidden countersubject

I call these three the “elements” of the fugue.

For me, the beauty of this fugue is in how its beginning is so difficult to grasp, and yet as we come to the end it feels as if the music somehow “works”, despite Bach using the same four elements throughout. This is achieved through several techniques we will look at later, but in the beginning we have a more barebones presentation of these elements. If we look at the first two pages, the subject at least is treated rather simply. After the first subject, any repeats of the subject are called answers. There are two kinds of answers, a “real” one and a “tonal” one. Real answers are when the subject is transposed perfectly to the new key, without any change of interval. Tonal answers are when the intervals are changed to preserve the harmony and avoid dissonances. For these opening sections, Bach uses the traditional method of alternating between these two kinds of answers, first a tonal answer than a real one. What’s interesting about this is that all the real answers are the same, and therefore identical to the subject. Even the tonal answers are in the same key, and are identical to each other. 

img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/fugue8.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">Bars 4-6, tonal answer in the left hand</div>

When we look at these tonal answers, a problem arises: they are the same, but what key are they in? If we look at the first example of a tonal answer above, it’s very hard to place a key onto this music. We can suggest that since it is a fourth higher than the subject of a B minor fugue, it must be in the key of E minor. However, the A#, E#, and G# in the right hand all contradict this very strongly (highlighted blue). To make matters worse, we see the countersubject here quite clearly in the key of B minor, in bar 6. If we look further to the next two bars for help, we see this:

img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/fugue9.png" alt="">

Let’s try again. Perhaps we can look to the HS in bar 4 for help (seen below). Unfortunately, this first HS is a complete mess: not only does it have the previously mentioned E# and G#, it can’t even agree with itself and has both C# and C natural! The countersubject is usually in the dominant, and all the notes except the C natural do agree with F# major. Hence, we might say the HS is presented here in F# major and try and brush the C natural under the rug with some desperate excuse; perhaps Bach wanted the intensity of a tritone to darken the music? 

img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/fugue10.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">It’s quite unsatisfying to say the above passage is in F# major (bar 4)</div>

Even if we allow ourselves such freedom of interpretation (which I am definitely guilty of in analysis), the picture still doesn’t make sense. We have the tonal answer in E minor, the CS in B minor, and the HS in F sharp major! Remember, all of these subjects have chromatic notes in them, which makes identifying the key even tougher, and puts into question all the work we have done to even get to this point. 

Even if we allow ourselves such freedom of interpretation (which I am definitely guilty of in analysis), the picture still doesn’t make sense.

Remember, all of these subjects have chromatic notes in them, which makes identifying the key even tougher, and puts into question all the work we have done to even get to this point.

The solution here is simple: <b>I don’t know what key this is in.</b> There’s nothing wrong with admitting defeat, and in fact I don’t believe that anyone can pin a key to these four bars without controversy. Extending that thought; I don’t believe that these four bars have a singular key. This brings a deadly question with it: Are these four bars atonal?

<div class="header">The Treatment of Tonality </div>

Firstly, the fugue as a whole is definitely tonal; it is in the key of B minor. Its subject seems to be in B minor, and it ends definitively on a B minor cadence, although with a raised third (this raised third is present in every minor prelude and fugue of this book). We can attribute a key to all of the subjects and bits and pieces, and yet when we look at them together we run into problems. When we zoom even further out and look at the fugue as a whole, suddenly it regains a strong tonal centre. How is this possible? I’ve spent a lot of time so far running around in circles with different keys to make a point: I don’t believe we can analyse this music in a black and white way, with definite chords and harmonies.

Yet, I don’t believe this music at <i>any</i> point has no tonal centre; it is constantly grounded in a sense of functional harmony, just that Bach has adapted it in a very special way. I think this fugue is the most creative piece of music to exist in the Baroque period, and in my opinion even today its inventiveness is only matched by late Beethoven. Let’s forget what we have learnt in theory class and try to look at this in another way.

Before we tackle these four bars, let’s return to something simpler. The “key” of the subject has been roughly defined by me; I used the frequency of repeated notes to identify a kind of B minor-F# major/minor relationship. This can be taken further, if we use some creativity to approach the problem. The greatest issue I think is that the most commonly repeated note is F#, which is of course not the tonic note. Here’s my solution:

img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/fugue11.png" alt="">

The first two F sharps in the subject in blue are what I consider to be B Minor F Sharps. The first F sharp is part of a B minor triad, while the second is an appoggiatura from the note G. G is in B minor, but not in either of the F sharp keys. If we look at the next two F Sharps in red, they are “true” F sharps, I consider them to be the tonic of the F sharp scale. There is symmetry here: the third F sharp is in a similar appoggiatura, this time on the accented note leading to E#. E# is not in the B minor scale, but is the seventh degree of the F sharp scale. Similarly, the final F sharp is part of a F sharp minor triad, placing it firmly in that key. If we look at it again, I suggest a different split of these repeated notes:

Three B naturals, Two D naturals, Two B minor F sharps, Two C sharps, Two “real” F sharps.

This classification of tones is much more pleasing. The most commonly used tone is the tonic, and every other important tone is used twice. Can we really look at music this way? Although you wouldn’t generally find techniques like this in a textbook, I think that it’s important to have a certain freedom in analysing these difficult pieces. I’ll be using techniques like this to bring some theoretical clarity to the rest of the music. I don’t think that this piece is atonal, but Bach has used a kind of tonality that is unfamiliar to us. It’s a kind of alternative tonality, ALTonality, if you will. (I promise never to use that name again, it’s confusing).

<div class="header">Finishing What We Started </div>

With a less restricted sense of tonality, let’s see if we can see a method behind the madness of these three bars (4-6, in case you forgot). I suggested that the subject is in E minor, simply because it is for the most part a fourth up. Let’s look at it another way now. First, we can see that the opening triad has been changed, instead of F sharp minor the C sharp has been brought down to a B natural. If we look through the subject, we can also notice that it’s now missing a tone: the C natural. Bach has carefully avoided these two tones all the way until the end, where there is a small resolution. The final long note of this tonal answer is the missing C sharp. When it should have been the first note, it’s instead the last. I find this very similar to the question of the subject, whether it resolves in F sharp minor or major. Here, we get a definitive answer, the C sharp is the more important tone.  How did Bach resolve the missing C natural?

Bach wanted to use this C natural somewhere in this music, and we see it in bar four in the HS. This feels like a note out of place, but I think it has been placed here out of necessity. It adds colour, but more importantly it maintains the kind of twelve tone dissonance that has been going on. There’s some proof of this: looking to the HS in bar 9, we can see that every note has been inverted but the C natural has not been maintained. Instead both the fourth and last note of these eight semiquavers is the same, rather than a semitone apart (If the inversion was perfect, the note in blue below should be a B sharp). I told you I would get back to this “mistake” in the inversion.

img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/fugue12.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">The HS presented in Bar 9. This is the real HS, what we have in bar 4 is a variation of it</div>

Hence, we get this rather confusing idea that the first time the HS is presented it is already modified. It is like starting immediately with a tonal answer before we have even heard the subject. For proof of this, in bar 13 we once again see the HS in its inverted form, a real answer to the HS in bar 9. This brings with it quite a revelation: the first HS in bar 4 cannot be seen again in the entire piece, so perhaps it’s <i>not</i> the real hidden subject, but rather an inversion of it. This is exactly why it felt so “hidden” to begin with. The real HS is actually the second one, found in bar 9! <b>We are hearing a variation before the theme.</b> This first inverted HS in bar 4s then joined to the CS by the descending crotchets, and here we can see that the key is changed to B minor. This leads us nicely into the next real answer of the subject.

This first, modified HS is another fantastic example of ALTonality (I lied). Normally the point of a tonal answer is to modify the intervals of a subject to keep it consonant with the new key. A common application of this is to change the minor third to a major third if we have gone to the relative major. But by changing the HS here, Bach has made it into almost an atonal answer! Of course, its purpose is to fill in the tones missing in the subject. While these bars do not have a conventional tonal centre, there are both melodic and harmonic reasons to all the notes that fit into the specific keys and concepts Bach is playing with, and I hope I have explained some of them.

<div class="header">Consonance vs Dissonance</div>

This idea of dissonant tonal answers and consonant real answers is one that can be explored further. Let’s compare the next two entrances of the subject:

img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/fugue13.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">Real Answer, bars 9-11</div>
img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/fugue14.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">Tonal Answer, bars 13-15</div>

As we can see here, the real answer is far more consonant than the tonal answer. In the real answer there is some looseness in tonality, paticularly the use of modal interchange to hint at the major key in bar 10, with the D and G sharps (dark red). However, apart from this the passage is very easy to listen to, especially when compared to what has come before. Here we see the real HS, which helps by being clearly in one key, in this case B minor. It is placed above five notes that are also clearly in the key of B minor. By combining the real HS and the real subject, Bach has created a much more conventional passage of music. 

In bars 4-6, we had the mixing of two tonal answers, which were in a different “key”, which is what led to all the clashing tones. Then, we had two real answers in bars 9-11, which resulted in a more consonant passage. What if we mix a real answer and a tonal answer? We see precisely this in bar 13, where the tonal subject is combined with a real answer of the HS. 

I would say the result of this is predictably in-between the two. It has some odd harmonies, and a couple of awkward tritones as highlighted above in pink. However, there’s not really any crazy dissonances like the previously seen C sharp to C natural in the inverted HS. More interesting are the two orange notes above, which are free counterpoint written by Bach for a very specific purpose. The D sharp is easier to make sense of, it is there to mirror the following D sharp in the soprano voice. The E sharp is far more interesting. 

This note should really be a E natural. It fits well with the theme of semitones that Bach has been building in the fugue, and it forms a nice dominant seventh harmony as well as avoiding the direct minor second dissonance with the held F sharp in the bass. An E natural here would also prepare the E natural in the soprano voice. Bach however refuses to conform to expectations, and the E sharp is there in all its glory. This forms a more dissonant diminished seventh chord, which is parallelled by the strange diminished resolution at the end of this passage. This final ch  ord takes on the extremely colourful half-diminished quality for the first semiquaver of the countersubject, before “resolving” to a C# diminished triad that is held over the articulated semiquavers of the CS. While the polyphony here is quite cute in its avoidance of traditional tonality, in my opinion it is not as outlandish as the first example we looked at from bars 4-6. At the very least some conventional harmonies can be observed here, and most of the guilty notes are hidden in the alto voice (much like in a choir!), rather than clearly displayed in the soprano or bass voices where the impact is greater.

<div class="header">Taking a Break </div>
After this first page or so of music, we are given a taste of more classic Baroque writing, a wonderful sequence of descending polyphonic melody, made out from a short, staggered five note motif:

img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/fugue15.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">Taken from the actual fugue: bar 18, colours show the separate repeated motifs</div>

This little figure of music is in a sense infinite, it can descend forever until we run out of notes. Because of this, it provides a break from the chaotic dissonance with its cyclical harmonic nature; the example below shows how it can repeat forever as it passes through all the keys:

img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/fugue16.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">A short example of how this could be extended, this time in a sequence of four</div>

However, Bach is consistent in his use of this material, and doesn’t let it go on endlessly. He uses three sequences of this motif, an interlude, and then three more sequences back into the main theme.  These six sequences together I call an “episode” of music. There are altogether three episodes in this fugue. The first two are tonally and structurally identical, with the interlude between the sequences a false entry of the theme (the first three notes of the theme): 

img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/fugue17.png" alt="">

More excitingly, the third and last episode is extra special. Instead of using the false entry of the subject to break up the six sequences, Bach uses the countersubject!

img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/fugue18.png" alt="">

How versatile are the elements of this fugue that they can be substituted here and there as Bach pleases. Even though these elements earlier seemed so dissonant and unlike each other (remember bars 4-6?), now we realise that actually they can work with each other all throughout the music! From three elements in three different “keys” all fighting for attention, we now have different elements fulfilling the same purpose. How is this possible?

<div class="header">Finding True Harmony</div>

I must be honest, when we first spilt the music into the four elements and looked Bach’s methods of joining them in bars 4-6, I did it in a deliberately convoluted way. The first three bars of polyphonic writing are the most difficult to understand, and I made matters worse when I presented a flawed version of the HS as it’s true form. I think the spirit of the music in bars 4-6 is like this, it is meant to confuse and bewilder, that much can be realised just by listening to it. Textbook thinking and harmonic analysis struggle to unravel these passages. I love music theory because in my opinion it is flexible, and <b>the same music can be interpreted in different ways, just like in performance.</b> 

Similarly, Bach’s subjects in this fugue are equally flexible. This is how he is able to find some order from the chaos, and this order only becomes clearer as we get deeper and deeper into the fugue. I’ve picked out one of the simpler examples of this: Bach’s resolution of the countersubject. If we look at the real countersubject, its resolution looks simple. The semitone resolves a step upwards, like so:

img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/fugue19.png" alt="">

However out of the first six playings, only half have this “correct” resolution. The rest all resolve in a exotic diminished fourth, like this example in bar 24:

img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/fugue20.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">D# to G forms a very strange interval</div>

This diminished fourth resolution is slowly weeded out through the rest of the fugue. Although this awkward resolution maintains a similar frequency throughout the piece, it’s overshadowed by a new kind of countersubject: a tonal answer to the original one, in the major key. Below is bar 33:

img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/fugue21.png" alt="">

We see first the “bad” resolution of the diminished fourth, but Bach immediately replies it with a “good” resolution of a semitone. The impact of this corrected resolution is even more intenseas it comes with a drastic modulation to the foreign key of C# major, which is both in a far away key and the first time we hear the countersubject in a major tonality. This harmonises nicely with the counterpoint in the right hand, resolving on a perfect C# major chord. Excluding the episodic material which is inherently consonant for a reason, this is literally the first full triad that isn’t implied or suspended, where all three voices are played together on the strong beat(even if it is only for a semiquaver). It’s even in root position! Naturally, it has tremendous impact. We get our first full triad in bar 34 of a baroque work!

Finally, we can look at the last occurrence of the countersubject to see this point quite literally hammered home. Here we see the countersubject repeated three times in sequence, and all of them have the “correct” resolution, right till the end where we have the satisfying conclusion on the long note. 

img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/fugue22.png" alt="">

Here is the final resolution of the countersubject; it’s finally willing to play by the rules, and three times in a row at that. We have long left the diminished fourth behind.

<div class="header">Chords</div>

As we come to the end of the fugue, we also notice the first truly distinct chord progression. Previously a lot of the harmony has been lost in a sea of polyphonic writing, but here there are clearly chords; what is not so clear is what they are and how they fit together.

img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/fugue23.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">Chords of bar 73 respelled into traditional four-part harmony. Rhythm has been left out for clarity</div>

The first one is simple enough, it is the first inversion of the B minor chord. The second chord in this picture is my favourite; the diminished seventh made from two stacked tritones. This resolves in the most crazy way; it resolves to a second inversion C major chord! Does this work, and what makes it work?

This tritone resolution is irregular, the ideal resolution would have both tritones resolving outwards or inwards, like so:

img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/fugue24.png" alt="">

While the lower tritone resolves “correctly”, the upper tritone maingtains the C natural and goes <i>down</i> a tone in the alto (I think the technical term for this is “oblique” resolution. Somehow couldn’t find any info online however, someone please tell me if this is right). I think that this mistake is deliberate, Bach is trying to throw us off with this unconventional resolution. This brings even greater effect to the proper resolution we seen in the downbeat of the following bar, where the tritone resolves inwardly <i>and</i> the soprano voice has a nice and predictable semitone resolution in the countersubject, as previously mentioned. Bach has employed more than one technique here to make this final resolution all the more satisfying.

<div class="header">Stretto</div>

There are two more interesting points to note in this fugue, and for that we have to head back to the middle, gnarly development section. Often the development section is the most tricky to analyse as there is so much going on, and the development of themes can stray very far from the original music. In this fugue though, the thematic material is kept pretty consistent, despite how complex it is. Development is done through structure instead, and Bach’s use of <i>stretto</i> in the middle of the fugue rather than the end is especially interesting. There are three <i>stretto</i> sections in this fugue, which is surprisingly many, considering many fugues don’t even have a single <i>stretto</i>  within them.

Often, <i>stretto</i> is saved for the end of a fugue, as it brings with it a great drama and tension as we approach the final resolution. However, the <i>stretto</i>  in this fugue is actually very light, as the themes are barely stacked on each other. There is only one note where the theme is truly stacked, that is on the final note of the subject a new answer is layered beneath them. Despite this, Bach manages to maintain the polyphonic thickness of a <i>stretto</i>  by decorating the main subject with the other elements of the fugue. In bars 34-35, there is a <i>stretto</i> that incorporates both the subject (blue) and the HS(red), and then swaps them in different voices for maximum effect:

The second <i>stretto</i> of this fugue brings with it the second point of interest in this development section: the transformation of the subject into a major mode. While such a chromatic subject faces many difficulties in changing tonality (it is hard to tell if it is minor or major to begin with, so switching between these two modes if not impossible is very tricky), Bach has done something quite clever to the subject to suggest a more major sound. First, the opening triad of the subject has been changed to a major triad, rather than a minor one:

<div class="captions">Highlighted E-flat marks temporary return to dissonant minor seconds</div>

In this case, we see the first A Major triad in blue. Bach then goes ahead to change the following semitone into a tone: or a minor second to a major second. This change is not needed for the next two intervals because they are the two semitones in the A Major scale. However, I think Bach did not want to hurt the semitone structure of the subject too much, and that’s why he doesn’t let this theme go on to resolution, but rather layers on another subject on top of it in a <i>stretto</i>. 

This next subject begins with the D major triad, and also comprises first a major second and then the two semitones of the D major scale (i.e., they are tonally identical). After this, Bach puts his foot down and we go back to chromatic semitones; cleverly this is accompanied with a change in colour by a diminished harmony in the right hand. However despite the dissonant return of the minor second, this subject is resolved with a major rather than minor chord, and it’s the very same A Major we began with, giving these bars a wonderful cyclical feel not too different from the more consonant episodes intersperesd through the fugue. I would say that when the subject is played in this major mode, it is not only more consonant, but also more colourful. It shines a light through the pitch black B minor and heavy diminished dissonances that plague us throughout the entire fugue.

This fugue is brilliant, one of the marvels that came out of Bach’s mind, rivalling the Goldberg variations and his two Passions. It’s interesting to consider the more modern points of this fugue, and for me this fugue definitely reshaped my thinking of Baroque music. Bach in particular is a composer that is difficult to tie in terms of style to a period in history, such is his genius. Although his output was certainly massive, there are many <i>extremely</i> creative pieces of music among them. The Art of the Fugue and the Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue are two more examples of polyphonic music taken to the next level.

With regards to my friends, I agree that it can be challenging for people to enjoy this music. It’s very far removed from modern pop music, and this fugue in particular is really chromatic and dissonant at times (they probably thought I was playing a whole bunch of wrong notes!). I hate the mindset that classical music is more intellectual than other music, and I don’t think analysis heightens enjoyment of music. In this case I do the analysis because it excites me to do so, and I personally love to see how Bach has put his music together in the most magical way.

I don’t really write this to change the minds of my friends, but rather to open my own and really get deeper into my understanding of why I enjoy music. To me, this fugue, or any good polyphonic writing for that matter, has something special attached to it. I simply have always loved polyphonic music. There is no joy for me greater than to hear the entry of the theme after the composer has built it up over several bars. There is nothing more exciting than to hear the entry of a new subject halfway through a fugue. While many might consider fugal writing to be an overly intellectual chore that doesn’t produce the most emotionally moving music, I personally don’t think this way. I think that the <i>effort</i> that is taken to write and to make sense of a fugue is worth it, only contributes to the enjoyment. This is an effort that to me is felt rather than seen, and often on my first listening I can already feel that a fugue is special when it catches my attention (some of the fugues in Handel’s <i>Messiah</i> are like this, despite people often criticising that as simple writing). It is music like this that can truly stay fresh forever, as there’s always something new to hear with every listening.
