The Magic Flute (K620) is my favourite opera. The fairy-tale like story as well as the fun and whimsical characters immediately appealed to me when I learnt about the plot a few years ago. I generally prefer the comic opera to the dramatic one, and while this opera has its funny moments it is by no means a superficial composition.  While Mozart’s writing is beautiful in its simplicity, there is also a depth to the writing that might not be immediately obvious. 

<div class="header">A quick synopsis</div>

The antagonist of the story, the famous Queen of the Night, is at first presented to the audience as the tragic character. She has lost her daughter, Pamina, to the evil priest Sarastro. Hence, the protagonist of our story, Prince Tamino, sets off on the classic journey to rescue the damsel in distress. He is given the titular magic flute by the Queen to aid him on his quest, the traditional gift from the mentor. However, later it is revealed that she is tricking him, and Pamina has run off to join Sarastro’s temple, as he turns out to be a kindly old man.

Once Tamino learns the truth, the Queen can no longer rely on him to kill Sarastro and achieve her goals. She then goes to Panima, giving her a knife and threatening to disown her unless she kills the wizard. 	However, she refuses, and together with Tamino they go through a trial of wisdom to banish the Queen from the temple. Using the magic flute and their love, they conquer the trial (oh the irony) and live the rest of their days in Sarastro’s temple as a happy couple.

<div class="header">The Theme of Conflict</div>

I picked The Magic Flute here for a reason beyond giving myself an excuse to listen to it more often. <sup title="I genuinely feel guilty for not listening to the other Mozart operas more, mainly <i>Don Giovanni</i> and <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i>. I have been meaning to get into <i>Cosi fan tutte</i> as well..">1</sup> 
The theme of good against evil permeates the entire opera. While every story has a good character and a bad character, in The Magic Flute this duality of light and dark takes centre stage, both in the storytelling and in the music. This is immediately clear from the overture:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/mozart1.PNG" alt="">
<div class="captions">The opening chords of the opera</div>

Mozart has chosen to open this opera fortissimo, a grand entrance of the E flat major chord that is sure to hush the impatient audience. Immediately after, however, there is a rest, extended by a fermata. I love it when the conductor really waits here, leaving the listeners guessing. Maybe they expect a restatement of the tonic (boring!), or a leap to the dominant. Some watching might even guess that Mozart would surprise us with a more feminine IV chord, although this would be rather unexpected given the sheer volume of the opening.

More surprising still is what is written; immediately two chords in the relative C minor. From the brightness of E flat major, we go to the pitch black C minor, known from pieces such as the 5th Beethoven symphony. Mozart isn’t satisfied yet, and wants to further push the harmony. After another fermata rest, he opts to go for the first inversion of the E flat major chord. While this chord is in the original major, the inversion lends it to having a slightly darker, closed feel. This is because it can be mistaken for the 2nd inversion minor chord, or vic. I’m not sure about this, but I do enjoy testing my students on whether they can guess the tonality of this chord, and they often get it wrong. It still sounds rather major to me, but there is a sense it is “less” major than a root position chord. <sup title="Admittedly, Mozart’s use of the B-flat in the top voice throws a spanner in the works here. Still, I think that this is a chord that treads the line between major and minor.">2</sup>

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/mozart2.PNG" alt="">
<div class="captions">Notice how similar these two chords are. It can be very hard to hear the difference when hidden in the tenor voice like this.</div>

From the opening, we can see this theme of conflict in the opera, the middle ground where two opposites clash. The first chord is “good” and the second is “evil”, but what is the third? I think this third chord captures the spirit of the famous Queen of the Night character perfectly, she is first seen as a saviour but turns out to be a villain. It is this character I will study as she provides the perfect insight into this idea with her two arias.

<div class="header">The good: <i>O zittre nicht, mein liber sohn</i></div>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8t0b4zaQp28" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The Queen is first introduced to us in a scene where she has saved the life of our hero Tamino. We are then left waiting through some comedic scenes where we are introduced to a few of our side characters, before we finally get to hear the song of the saviour. <i>O zittre nicht, mein lieber sohn</i> (Oh, tremble not, my dear son) is the first of the Queen’s arias and incidentally, my favourite aria in the entire work. What else can we expect from a hero but a triumphant B-flat major introduction:
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/mozart3.png" alt="">

Yet there is a twist; Mozart’s music is never as clear cut as it seems. Here we can see a passage where he builds from the tonic to the dominant over 4 bars, adding more textures as he goes to build from piano to forte. However, there are two descending chromatic lines played by the second violin and bassoon (notes in blue). A lesser composer would certainly not have written these notes, which kill two birds with one stone. Not only do they create more colour, more importantly they foreshadow the sorrow that the Queen will express later in the aria, as seen below:
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/mozart4.PNG" alt="">

This concept of foreshadowing is something that will come up again and again, and is a cornerstone of Mozart’s opera writing.

With the orchestra leading us in, the Queen finally introduces herself in a recitative:
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/mozart5.png" alt="">

Nothing much to see here, the only two chords used are the tonic and dominant. Yet Mozart must bring us to the aria, where we see the Queen plead Tamino for help in saving her daughter. There, the sombre mood requires the minor key, and Mozart must bring us to the relative G minor. He prepares this through a mirrored phrase in the orchestra two bars later: 
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/mozart6.png" alt="">

This time, instead of dropping us on a “safe” chord within the key, Mozart puts us down on the secondary dominant to G minor, readying us for the eventual modulation. The words before this orchestral interlude read <i>du bist unschuldig, weise, fromm</i> (trans. You are innocent, young, pious). You can just hear the ominous tone of the Queen’s words with this D7 chord. Words in real life convey much of their meaning through intonation of the speaker. In opera, where sometimes a traditional sense of intonation cannot be used, music can be used to imply a character’s meaning as a substitute. The queen is not praising Tamino for these qualities, in fact she sees them as shortcomings which she can abuse to manipulate him.

The aria then begins proper in the expected key of G minor. This aria is split into two parts, first comes the Queen’s lament to Tamino, “grieving” her daughter’s disappearance. Later we will return to B flat major as she promises the reward of her daughter’s hand in marriage. Before that, let’s see how convincing the Queen’s sorrow is, with the knowledge we now have of her deceit. 
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/mozart7.png" alt="">

Once again, the first phrase gives away nothing. Here, the words mean “I am chosen for suffering”. It is a common trope in storytelling to have a character for the audience to sympathise with; to feel sorry for. Here the Queen presents herself as that character in as straightforward a way as possible. The first phrase of the recitative and aria parallel each other, both paint a false picture of the Queen by only using the tonic and dominant chords. Let’s look at another example, the Queen’s desperate cry for help:
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/mozart8.png" alt="">

The setting of these words <i>Ach helft</i> (trans. Oh help!) is as tragic as Mozart’s writing ever gets. First there is the interval of the tritone in the soprano line, from D to Ab, further accentuated by the diminished harmony in the orchestra. This diminished harmony can travel in several different ways, but it travels to the darkest. In a pleading, weaker cry where the queen can no longer reach the augmented fourth and settles for the perfect one, the chord progression drops to a C minor chord. Of course, we can link this to the “bad” C minor chord from the overture.

On the surface, everything is as it should be, but if going a little further into the music we begin to realise something is suspicious:
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/mozart9.png" alt="">

Here is the first real appearance of a major key in the aria. This takes place in the second bar of the above excerpt, where the Queen sings <i>ein Bosewicht</i>. These words actually mean “a villain”. What kind of villain is introduced on top of a fanfare like statement and ascending notes by the strings, and for the first time in a major key? Of course, this is foreshadowing again, prepare Sarastro's reveal as is a wise and generous priest, instead of a kidnapper. The harmony that introduces him being E flat major is a reprise of the very first chord of the opera (the “good” chord) signalling he is actually one of the protagonists of the story.	

Let’s look at the last line of this sorrowful section of the aria before we jump back into the joyful music. <i>Den meine Hulfe war zu schwach</i> (But my powers weren’t enough [to save my daughter]).
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/mozart10.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">The interrupted cadence at the end of this line. I consider the tonality here to be C minor, although it is somewhat ambiguous</div>

Here the Queen laments her lack of ability to save Pamina. However instead of the phrase ending in a dark and dreary way, it ends with an interrupted cadence! <sup title="Perhaps using a diminished seventh to resolve to the minor tonic chord, or something along those lines.">3</sup>
As we musician know, an interrupted cadence in a minor key will end with a major chord. Furthermore, this final chord is no ordinary major chord, it is the “good” Eb major chord. These interrupted cadences have a kind of playful feel to them; it is funny to take away the sadness with a major chord out of the blue. However, I think this line out of context cannot be used to prove much, it is important to see the bigger picture. Using an interrupted cadence to extend the last spoken line is a common technique used by Mozart, albeit rarely in a minor key. This is to allow the singer to repeat the last line, giving the second reading a sense of finality. So how does the Queen repeat this line?
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/mozart11.png" alt="">

The beginning of this second line is even purer in its sorrow. The “bad” C minor chord is used extensively here, this is why I believe it is the tonal centre of the music. Of note here are the two chords on the syllable <i>Hul</i> (beginning of bar 3 and 4). The first is an incredibly dissonant chord with the notes F-G-Ab-B. I can scarce believe Mozart would use a chord like this, but it is to represent how twisted the Queen’s corrupt power truly is. In bar 4, the syllable is place on a more conventional diminished chord which is our tool to resolve back to G minor. This resolution does happen, and perhaps we got the sense of the Queen’s sadness after all. However, before we get too satisfied with the cadence, we must look at <i>how</i> it happens. The resolution is fleeting, once we have landed on this chord Mozart immediately marks <i>allegro moderato</i>. Instantly we are pushed into the dominant of B flat major, and then plunged into B flat major itself. It is as if the Queen was bored of the charade, and wanted to show a facet of her true self: a stunningly powerful being. She will not yet explicitly show her evil side, but now she is more than willing to show the audience just how strong she really is.

The Queen of the Night role is known for its extreme difficulty. So far, although the singing has been tough, it has not yet distinguished itself from other more lyric roles in Mozart (e.g. Susanna from <i>Le nozze di Figaro</i>). Here, we finally get to hear some of the infamous coloratura runs of this role. The difficulty isn’t just for singers to show off (whatever they might believe!) but it shows off the Queen’s power. Here, the Queen is tempting Pamino as the Devil tempts humanity. She promises reward beyond his wildest dreams, and her daughter to be his forever. These rewards must be exaggerated, and they most certainly are:
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/mozart12.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">Just look at this soprano line!</div>
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/mozart13.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">The famous F natural. The high point of the music is set to the words "forever yours", referring to the Queen's daughter.</div>

The coloratura singing here must be impossible. The performer seems to be inhuman, after all, that’s the only way anyone could dream of singing a line like this. And the Queen <i>is</i> inhuman. Until now the audience still believes the Queen to be a creature of the light. They could interpret these lines as the Queen showing off an almost angelic quality, perhaps even some sign of divine power. Yet, with what we know and the clues Mozart has given us, we should not be reverent, but terrified. What will it be like when the Queen uses this power against us, and turns on the heroes of our story?

<div class="header">The bad: <i>Der Holle Rache kocht in meinen Herzen</i></div>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZNEOl4bcfkc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Almost an hour later and in a different act, the plot has thickened considerably. Sarastro has been revealed to be good, so of course the Queen must be evil. We know this, but we have not seen it. It isn’t surprising to me that the aria where the Queen turns is one of the most famous and popular in the repertoire. Not only does it show off the performers technique, it is the crucial turning point of the entire work. It contains by far the most drama of any aria in this relatively light-hearted work. Let’s continue looking at the first phrase of each aria:
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/mozart14.png" alt="">

The trend is continued here with the first phrase having only two chords, the tonic and the dominant. The first interesting harmony comes up a few bars later, and it is a chord saved for special occasions. Mozart rarely uses the Neapolitan sixth, saving it for some of his most emotional writing. Here we see it written on top of the word <i>Tod</i> (death): 
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/mozart15.png" alt="">

This is an abrupt shift of harmony and when heard has quite a chilling effect. It is like the secret dark side of the Queen has been suddenly revealed. Later this flattened 6th will be very important as we approach the climax of this aria. The technical reason for this Neapolitan harmony is to pull the music towards G minor, which it does but only briefly. Mozart does not want to commit to a foreign modulation and so he instead settles on the relative F major in the following line. He does that through liberal use of diminished seventh chords, a further reflection on the Queen’s nature.
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/mozart16.PNG" alt="">
<div class="captions">The previous line continued</div>

This major tonality might seem out of place in a song about death and despair, but the Queen enjoys these dark circumstances. She gets her joy from putting Pamina in the tough position of choosing between her mother or Sarastro’s life. Her true feelings regarding her daughter are revealed however, with the flattened third in this F major section on top of the word <i>Tochter</i> (daughter):
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/mozart17.png" alt="">

The moment she even has to speak the word “daughter”, a diminished chord appears from the previously major tonality. The Queen has no feelings for her daughter; Pamina is just a means to an end, the same way Tamino was. Her only goal is to kill Sarastro, and destroy his community. I don’t think she is personally affected by her daughter joining him, as she does not ask her to return or show grief at her departure. She only feels anger and lusts for death. The Queen really is the quintessential villain with no true motive except to be evil, which some might see as a weakness of the libretto. However, I see it as a strength, as it reinforces the themes of the opera; absolute good against absolute evil. 

Back to the aria at hand, let’s compare the coloratura runs between the two arias. Both are fiendishly difficult, but where previously we only had running notes now we also have broken chords with varying intervals. There is a difference in the texture of the coloratura runs now, in many ways they are harder as the Queen finds it easier to express herself now that she no longer needs to hide her true nature. There are many more of the high F naturals in this aria as well, where there is only one in <i>O zittre nicht</i>. This second aria is definitely more extroverted than the first, which is more inward looking, at least before its jubilant finale. Here the dialogue between the Queen and the instrumentalists is also more apparent, with the two mimicking each other’s lines. It is as if the entire orchestra is under the Queen’s spell.
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/mozart18.png" alt="">

Finally, we come to the climax of the work; perhaps the climax of the entire opera. Hear the queen shrieks <i>Hort!</i> (Hear!), literally shouting to the Gods her cry of death. This is built on the D minor triad, but her last terrifying note is on the flattened sixth, drawn from the Neapolitan harmonies earlier in the work. Although this is spelt as a flattened sixth (as it should be), I like to think of it as a raised 5th. This note should be as sharp as possible, to the point where it is close to a B natural. For a role as dramatic as the Queen’s, it is not so important that the singing is mechanically in tune, but rather that the horror of this cry really comes through to the audience.
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/mozart19.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">This high B-flat achieves a sense of fear the A natural simply cannot</div>

Here, there is not only the flattened sixth in the Queen’s line, but the D minor Neapolitan sixth harmony is reprised in the orchestra. The Neapolitan harmony here encompasses the entire aria, so I think it is important to consider its colour. While subjective, I think that the Neapolitan is the darker cousin to the diminished supertonic chord in a minor key. Even if the intervals in a Neapolitan sixth are more spread out than in a diminished chord, its colour is altogether more mysterious and hard to grasp, and has a sense of death to it. I don’t think it is coincidence that Mozart used this chord most frequently in his last and greatest work, the unfinished <i>Requiem</i>.

In <i>O Zittre Nicht</i>, we heard a temporary minor modulation used by Mozart before immediately returning us to a major key. Here, we see its inversion. At the end of the aria the orchestra settles for only a quaver on a B-flat major chord (also the key of <i>O zittre nicht</i>), before ascending chromatically to a final perfect cadence. In this last phrase, the diminished seventh is used to great effect on the closing line of the Queen, (trans. Hear! This mother’s oath), both to colour the words and to push the harmony to its inevitable D minor end. Mozart above all else was extremely efficient with his writing here, with only two songs of about five minutes each he has turned an apparent hero into one of the most memorable villains of any opera.

<div class="captions">The Queen's last phrase, sung in silence. A final call to the Gods</div>

<div class="header">The Ugly? A moment away from the music</div>

I have often heard the idea that in opera the story is unimportant and the libretto is immature. While these arguments do have valid points, I don’t think this school of thought applies to The Magic Flute, at least not entirely. While the plot has its shortcomings, there are also interesting quirks in The Magic Flute’s story I would like to touch on with regards to these two arias. Firstly, after <i>O zittre nicht</i> the Queen gives Tamino the magic flute, but after <i>Der holler rache</i> she gives Pamina a knife. The theme of polarity and conflict is very evident in this opera; every action has an opposite. The Queen’s high Fs are negated by Sarastro’s low Fs. The knife kills while the flute protects, and the trial the lovers go through is comprised of fire and ice. This is why I chose to focus on the theme of good vs evil in my analysis of this opera.

Another important concept in this opera is the idea of naming. The Queen doesn't have a name; rather she is known by her title. The Queen never calls Pamina by name either, just referring to her as a daughter. Yet, many of the songs are constructed using character’s names, for example the wonderful <i>Pa-Pa-Pa-Papagena! duet</i> near the end of the opera. There the pa vowel is used to imitate a bird’s call as two lovers sing their names to each other. Another example is the farewell between Tamino and Pamina in the trio <i>Soll ich dich</i>, which is so full of passion and hope even as they are forcefully separated. It always brings back my attention if I have drifted off while listening.  Names are used to establish love between two characters in both these examples, so the Queen’s reluctance to call her daughter by name is sign of her hatred, while her lack of a name might suggest she cannot feel love at all.
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/mozart21.png" alt="">
<div class="captions">Here there is a romantic plagal cadence. Also to note is their unison on the word Lebewohl, or goodbye</div>

The Magic Flute’s story and music are very similar. Both appear to be simple, even childish on the surface. However, going deeper into the music and the ideas that Mozart explored can lead to many discoveries, both about his style of writing and his ability to paint a picture with just a few words to work with. Mozart is today still considered one of the greatest opera writers, ranked among Rossini, Verdi or Puccini. 

After all, I have only covered one character and two arias so far. The work still offers so much. Other highlights include love duets more romantic than any pop song, as well as the adorable bird-calling theme from <i>Der Vogelfanger ich bin ja</i>, which is transformed throughout the entire opera, much in the style of the drinking theme of <i>La Traviata</i>. Mozart's operas are to me the gold standard the Romantic composers looked up to, and are a fantastic choice if you are looking to jump into the world of opera. I’d encourage everybody with the time to listen to The Magic Flute at least once; it can open you up to a whole new genre of music that can seem intimidating, but is actually incredibly rewarding.
