A capella singing has fascinated me for a long time. I think that the human voice is the purest instrument; and having unaccompanied music for the voice can produce some of the most beautiful sounds ever put to paper. However, it is very easy for a capella music to become boring, and it places a great burden on both the composer and the performers. Uninventive writing quickly causes the music to become stale, and slight intonation errors can ruin the sound of the entire piece. There is a mystical chorale sound, where the four voices are so perfectly in harmony that only a few singers can fill a concert hall. This sound is desperately and painstakingly sought by even the most professional choirs, and modern a capella groups settle for autotune to mimic this resonance. Yet, in my opinion there is a potential in this kind of music to paint colours that are truly unique. There is no better example of this is in one of the oldest pieces of music I know, the famous Allegri <i>Miserere</i>.

There is a wonderful story that accompanies this piece of music. The Catholic Church had protected this setting of Psalm 51 from the public, and only three scores were in existence, and even they were mere approximations of the correct notes. The true secret the church was hiding was the technique of <i>abbellimenti</i>, or their style of ornamentation when singing the music. However, the Church could not prepare for the genius of a certain Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who at the age of fourteen transcribed the entire score purely from ear after two hearings. Unfortunately, the tradition of <i>abbellimenti</i> is lost in the modern practice of this music, which is performed from a very controversial score.

After Mozart, other composers also made their own transcriptions of this music. Most notably Felix Mendelssohn made a transcription, but for some reason wrote it a fourth higher. When there was a push for serious editions of music rather than just pieces of manuscript paper, musicologists worked together to publish scholarly editions of music. Certain musicologists believe that when this happened, they accidentally meshed the Mozart and Mendelssohn transcriptions together, which is what produces the incredibly haunting yet historically inaccurate high C in the soprano. Furthermore, at this point they most likely lost any Renaissance ornamentation that might have been written down. I too subscribe to this belief, as any informed listening to this work as it is performed today will in no way suggest it is a hundred percent authentic Renaissance piece.

Yet, I consider this a happy accident, as what we <i>do</i> have is one of the greatest pieces of sacred music in existence. From this, we also get to see the origin of the term a capella; it means “from the chapel” in Italian. Whether the score is historically accurate does not matter to me, I instead choose to enjoy the music in its current form. To me, this is a prime example of how composers could achieve great music even before there were many properly developed instruments. The voice was the first instrument ever created, after all.

<div class="header">The Baroque</div>

When looking to the Baroque period, instruments have reached a higher technological level and composers are starting to experiment with purely instrumental works. The concerto grosso is coming into fashion, which hint at the beginnings of the Classical concerto and symphony. However, vocal music was still a priority for the composers of this time. We have the massive works like the Handel Messiah or the Pergolesi Stabat Mater, yet for a capella music there is no better choice than the Bach chorales. 

Today, there are over 400 surviving Bach chorales with several more probably lost to the ages. Some of these are not for the voice (misleading title if you ask me), but are instead transcribed to be played on the organ or rarely the harpsichord. However, most of them involve a SATB choir as well as homophonic writing, in contrast to the polyphonic writing of the Renaissance. Roughly half of these are without accompaniment, while the rest have accompaniment written in figured bass. I consider this to be a technical limitation, as not every chapel was outfitted with a functional organ. However, because of this, whether the music is written with accompaniment or not, the choral part hand to function <i>alone</i>. The figured bass was usually just a direct doubling of the vocal parts in either case, without any extra flourishes or harmonisations. Hence, I still consider this to be a capella music, music that maintains its effect without accompaniment.

Above we have a chorale from the <i>St. Matthew Passion</i>. Unfortunately, I could not find an unaccompanied version of this chorale (or frankly any Bach chorale for that matter), so I decided to use one of my favourites. I do not understand the reluctance to perform this music unaccompanied today, and would love an explanation for this. In this chorale, we can tell that the instruments are merely doubling the parts, perhaps adding some of that extra resonance to make the music easier to perform, as well as keepingn the choir in tune. My belief is that even though the figured bass accompaniment is written in the composer’s hand, it is merely a <i>suggestion</i>, and entirely optional. This is like how many of Bach’s choices of instrumentation in his B minor mass are often substituted in modern interpretations. I honestly think that this redundant doubling can be done away with, and it will add an entire new dimension to the whole work. Perhaps one day I can suggest such an idea to one of my conductor friends before they present this music. 

<div class="header">A Dying Art</div>

With the Classical Period came big changes. Firstly, instrumental music began to take precedence over vocal music, especially with Haydn and his 104 symphonies. Opera and secular music in general also grew in popularity, and the colour of a capella singing was often inappropriate for these works. In those days, a capella music had a strong religious connotation which is still carries to some extent today. Haydn and Mozart did write a significant amount of sacred choral works, yet I have not found a single example of homophonic a capella writing in any of them. Even if one or two were to exist, they would be a drop in the ocean, compared to Bach where literally every cantata, motet, or oratorio is filled to the brim with chorales. Instead, instruments were used to enhance the choir, and add their own independent colours and textures. I imagine that composers in those days who still wrote in the Baroque style were considered old fashioned, and unwilling to use the new instruments and colours available to them.

Above is the Magnificat from Mozarts' <i>Vesperae solemnes de confessore</i>, and it is obviously different from the music we have heard so far. The orchestra and choir are equally important here, enjoying a symbiotic relationship. Also, there is a soloist who sings between the choral parts, as well as generally more complex and extensive instrumentation.   

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/choral1.png" alt="">

Above we can see how the strings and voices carry a completely different melody, unlike the doubling we have previously heard. In bars 1-2 of the example, we can see the semiquaver figures pushing the harmony ahead before the chorus comes in on their next note. Even on the Amen cadence (last bar), although the harmony is precisely the same, the strings are playing restless semiquavers against the crotchets in the voices. Here, taking the instrumentation away won’t improve the colour. Instead, the orchestra is what lends that extra dimension to the choral writing. A good orchestra is vital to properly present music like this.

After this lull of about 50 years, Beethoven in his final years took an interest to this kind of music. Beethoven composed several pieces of choral music, with the ninth Symphony and the <i>Missa Solemnis</i> among his finest works. His C minor Mass as well as the <i>Choral Fantasy</i> are in my opinion a little hit and miss, and not an accurate reflection of his usual standards.

The <i>Missa Solemnis</i> was finished in 1823, when Beethoven was by most accounts completely deaf. This is my favourite work by Beethoven, yet it has not achieved the popularity of his symphonies and sonatas today. I will most likely make a post about this work someday, but for now I will briefly look at the last movement, the Agnus Dei. Of the 6 movements, I would say this one is the most modern, although the entire work looks to the future. It is both structurally and harmonically very advanced, and to some extent I think that it can only be poetic fate that such brilliance was dreamed up by someone destined never to hear it.

There are a few parts to this Agnus Dei, but I would say that it is a work of two colours. It opens dark and tragic, almost like a funeral march, as the soloists and chorus plead <i>miserere nobis</i> (Grant us pity). However, at bar 96 there is a change of tempo from <i>Grave</i> to <i>Allegretto vivace</i>, as the chorus now prays for peace (<i>dona nobis pacem</i>). Immediately we get a glimpse of a capella colours, in bars 97-99, with the vocal line being doubled in the orchestra without harmony. However, this is not yet a complete phrase, and the orchestra eventually comes in with some additional parts to build up the music. Beethoven is slowly bending the rules, testing their breaking point. Soon, there will be an even more magical moment.

This is to my knowledge the first unaccompanied choral phrase written by a great composer in over half a century. And it is an incredibly special moment as well, especially when viewed in context. This piano marking in the score is actually a <i>subito piano</i> (Beethoven’s speciality), and this phrase comes immediately after a little <i>fugato</i> section. The theme of the <i>fugato</i> before has been stacked on top of itself in the previous bars in a <i>stretto</i>, and all the voices are coming to a huge resolution, with a crescendo marking throughout. I’m sure most of the people reading this will know how exciting a <i>stretto</i> in a fugue is, and how much pull it has towards a resolution. However, when the resolution  does comes, we are surprised by the sudden hush from the choir, and the immediate silence of the orchestra. This instant change of colour always gives me goosebumps, provided the choir can stay in tune! This is possibly my favourite moment in all music, bar the finale of Mahler’s second symphony. For the impatient, it comes at around 7:30 in the video. But do yourself a favour, and listen to the whole work.

This a capella theme appears over and over in the music, however this is the only time the phrase is entirely unaccompanied. This is significant, as it then allows Beethoven to elaborate on this phrase with different textures. It is also this phrase that closes the music, finishing the entire work of more than an hour. In this final statement, the orchestration is doubled similarly to a Bach chorale, as the declaration of peace is made <i>forte</i>. After all, the <i>Missa Solemnis</i> is as much a humanist work as a religious one, and Beethoven wanted to emphasise the importance of peace and acceptance in his final years on earth. Two hundred years later, we could stand to take a moment and consider this message.

<div class="header">Beyond Beethoven</div>

Certain Romantic composers also favoured this technique of a capella singing, with Brahms, Bruckner and Mahler all throwing little fragments of it into their compositions. Here is the final phrase from the Bruckner <i>Mass in F Minor</i>, a work dear to my heart since I performed it last year.

There are many similarities to Beethoven here, the text is the same, and it is the same short phrases that are given the a capella treatment in the scope of a huge work. Actually, it is not too far removed from the <i>St Matthew Passion</i> previously discussed either. In that work, the chorale movements are interspersed between a whole variety of other types of music (arias, orchestral preludes etc.) and these big Romantic works can also be segmented into many smaller parts. For the next evolution of a capella music, we must look a few years ahead. Here we come full circle, as choral pieces are composed <i>entirely</i> without accompaniment; the same as in the Renaissance. Here we have another setting of the Agnus Dei, this time by Samuel Barber.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FOwRW8ee4S8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Of course, this work is just a transcription of his Adagio for strings, and arguments can be made that it is merely a cash grab by the composer to secure additional profits from choirs around the world. However, there are some slight differences to the notes compared to the version for string orchestra, and of course the timbre and colour are completely different. Many people consider this music to be associated with death, especially with its frequent use in mass media, particularly in scenes of war or loss. In fact, the Adagio was played in Singapore at the state funeral of our ex-president S R Nathan. However, I think that this work represents life. Barber’s choice to set the music to the Agnus Dei text, which although about death, is more accurately a promise of eternal life after death. He could easily have set the music to a more tragic Requiem text, but instead chose to focus on a message of forgiveness and peace.

<div class="header">A capella Music Today</div>

I am not a big fan of a capella arrangements of pop music, although they are well liked among most young people and I do encourage the continuation of this tradition of music making. Here we have something more down my alley, an a capella transcription of the famous Nimrod from the <i>Enigma Variations</i> by Edward Elgar.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IwdeqVmXlHk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Voces8 are a modern a capella group that primarily sings arrangements of classical music. Although I can’t agree with the use of autotune here to increase the resonance (much like how Bach and Beethoven used doubling to increase resonance!), this work is still very well performed. What strikes me is how the arrangement of a clearly Romantic work into this form, with a Latin text, makes it sound so much like Renaissance music. The words are set to the Communion of the Requiem Mass, which focuses on eternal light shining on the dead, another similarity to the music we have seen so far. 

There is a theme here, and I deliberately tried to keep all the examples consistent to show this. The music explored is all religious, and furthermore they are all sung to roughly the same text (except the Bach chorale). There is an association between a capella singing and an angelic choir; but I think that the reason it so often ends up that way is because of technical rather than musical reasons. It is extremely hard for a choir to stay in tune without the help of other instruments, so slow and haunting stepwise melodies often fit this music best. Composers then merely choose an appropriate text for this colour. However, there is something special about humans making music alone, without relying on what are essentially machines to keep them in pitch. With the advancement of choral societies all around the world, I think that budding composers should try and take this opportunity to explore this niche area of music. There is certainly something left to be discovered, and new colours to work with.
