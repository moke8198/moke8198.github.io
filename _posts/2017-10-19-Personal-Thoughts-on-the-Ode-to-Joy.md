Many things come to mind when one starts the learning process for a well known piece of music, especially for one as monumental as Beethoven’s Ode to Joy. Aside from technical aspects, ensemble work and the added pain of hearing “Morh-de” instead of “Moh-de” for 2 months, there is an inner need to work with the text and tease out it’s meanings. It is one thing to know the meaning of each and every word, it is another thing to project this meaning. 

Beethoven doesn’t help much in that regard. His infamously unfriendly voice writing reaches it’s peak with his last symphony, with several sublime and tender moments resting on the higher end of the scale for many a singer, even those who have experienced it before. Yes, I know he was completely deaf when he began to compose this symphony, but I will not give him a break, not till my dying days. I almost feel as if Berlioz wrote his book on Orchestration with the 9th Symphony as a “What NOT to do” example, and have all of his advice thrown out the window by Bruckner and Wagner.

You’d expect that for such a symphony riddled with problems and challenges vocally as well as instrumentally that such a work would leave many performers disgruntled by the end of the final cadence, seeking to drown their ironic “Freude” in pints of beer. But in the end, we all left the concert hall with spring in our step and “Freude” in our hearts (and the god damned fugue in my head). I had often espoused my contempt for the vocal parts of the Ode to Joy, and my sentiments were shared by my peers regardless of being a voice or instrumental major. So how does a work that is universally acknowledged to be full of problems for singers and instrumentalists alike still find a place in the hearts of all those who perform or hear it?

Perhaps this is where Beethoven’s genius truly lies; where he is able to transform our own opinions,set them aside for 65 minutes and allow us to sing in the true spirit of brotherhood and joy. Perhaps in spite of Beethoven’s notoriously unfriendly voice writing, orchestrational issues and ever present deafness, Beethoven’s message of Joy, brotherhood and transcendental wonder shines ever brighter in a symphony that changed the course of western musical history. 

I foresee using “Joy” and “Freude” a lot today. 

I know Michael’s views and his immense admiration for Beethoven, and I’m sorry to say I do not share them. I put it down to being trained as a singer rather than a pianist, and my admiration lies with the more vocally inclined composers (give me Mozart or Donizetti anyday over Beethoven). Even after an ecstatic concert,  I still have my reservations of Beethoven’s vocal works. I still hold firm that Beethoven was a master orchestrator, brilliant innovator and forefront of early romantic piano repertoire. However, he also wrote terribly for the voice and I would not touch his weird vocal music with the phrase length of Barber’s Agnus Dei.But, I am willing to concede the Ode to Joy a place in my heart, for it’s emotional and spiritual worth regardless of the pain it causes my larynx. 

You win this round Beethoven, but just this round.
