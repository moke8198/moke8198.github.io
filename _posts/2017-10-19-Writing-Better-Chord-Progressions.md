If you’re like me, you like to mess around on the piano more than sit down and practice seriously. Instead of playing from my exam scores, I’ll improvise a little passage, play some music by ear or read a piece and do variations on the melody or accompaniment. While this has its drawbacks (less time for serious practice!), it has several advantages as well. I think it helps to increase the musical creativity of the pianist, as well as sharpen their sight-reading and aural sense. It also keeps the activity of practicing the piano fresh. In fact, I ask all my students to spend at least one practice session a week doing something fun on the piano, although I doubt they have the time to do so considering the amount of schoolwork young students have nowadays.

When it comes to improvisation however, I often find that me and my students hit this roadblock where we end up using the same chords all the time. I’ve both overcome and reencountered this block multiple times in my life. I still remember quite some time ago, when I was just getting into improvisation, I discovered the idea of a secondary dominant. It was like a whole new world to me when I realised you could use a E major chord in the key of C! I must have spent that entire day improvising with these new chords. Of course, they are now slightly less special to me, but they’re another “weapon” in my arsenal of chords.

I am always looking to find new chords and learn how we can use them. It is both important to have a good vocabulary and to understand the syntax of a language well for precise communication. This is equally true for a spoken language and a musician’s harmonic language. One of the best ways to learn a language is to observe what a natural speaker of that language does. With that in mind, I have some ideas on how to expand and improve our chord progressions, taken straight from Verdi’s <i>Ave Maria</i> in the fourth act of his opera <i>Otello</i>. Condensed into four minutes is a huge variety of harmonic techniques that we can all apply in our daily lives.

<div class="header">One Note, Many Chords</div>

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/otello1.png" alt="">

When the soprano voice enters into this aria, she is stuck singing an E flat repeatedly for five painfully slow bars. This is meant to replicate the speech of a typical prayer; the priestess whispering her vows desperately under her breath. Yet, Verdi keeps the music interesting by constantly changing the harmonies under this E-flat prayer. 

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/otello2.png" alt="">

Above is the condensed accompaniment to this prayer. In total, Verdi has used eight distinct chords in this progression. These chords range from a simple E flat major to a diminished seventh on A flat, but they all share one thing in common: they have the note E flat in them. In fact, this E flat is held by the first violin throughout the entire prayer, right at the top of the harmonies, perhaps as an opposite to a tonic pedal, a soprano pedal if you will.

Every single one of these chords has a different colour, and Verdi has shaded this music with a ton of excitement. This progression shows how if you use a single note to tie the music together, you can get away with very bold harmonic writing. The transition from a C minor chord to a E flat minor chord in the first inversion within four harmonic changes is a great example of this. Being bold with your progressions is not something to be afraid of; as long as there is melodic or rhythmic backbone, you can be freer with your harmonic choices. Imagine how boring this section would have been if Verdi stuck to only chords in the key of A flat Major!

<div class="header">So Many Secondary Dominants</div>

I talked about secondary dominants at the start of this post, and in my opinion they are the most important tool in playing beautiful progressions. They are the most versatile of the chromatic chords, and it’s no surprise to me that they are the most popular. They can be found especially commonly in Chinese pop songs; nearly all of them have at least one (the good ones at least!). Below we see an example of a very simple secondary dominant progression in the first verse of the prayer:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/otello3.png" alt=""> 
<div class="captions">V7/vi is a chord we all love</div>

Although secondary dominants used this way are wonderful, it is something we have all heard before and they can sometimes lose their magic. There is a way to make secondary dominants even more interesting, and that is when they resolve to another chord! For me, the way I think of it is that every chord either has a subdominant or dominant flavour. ii, IV, and vi all have the subdominant flavour, while chords like iii, V, and Ic all have a dominant flavour. Hence, if we have V/vi, we can easily resolve it to either ii or IV. With proper voicing and intent, this can lead to some incredible moments. Verdi recognises that here, with the same line in the second verse:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/otello4.png" alt=""> 

This is my favourite moment of the entire song. I always get goosebumps at the end of this phrase, and I hope everyone can hear how special this moment is. This subdominant talk leads us nicely into 

<div class="header">Don’t Be Afraid of the Plagal Cadence</div>

I find it amazing that the most precious phrase of this song ends with a IV-I cadence. This fits in beautifully with a prayer, but the plagal cadence is so much more than a tool to be placed under the word “Amen”. It adds a softer, slightly more feminine touch to the music and I wish composers would use it more often. I think realising you can end phrases with something other than ii7-Ic-V7-I is a big step into the world of more advanced harmony. 

An additional point to this is one of my favourite ending cadences: 
<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/otello5.png" alt=""> 

This variation of the plagal cadence works due to something called negative harmony. The theory is that the iv6 chord is a mathematical inversion of the V7 chord, and hence can take its place. Negative harmony is really complicated and I don’t understand it fully myself, so I won’t go into it here. However, this cadence at the end is really wonderful to end a phrase in a very warm way, and I’d recommend you give it a try.

<div class="header">All About That Bass</div>

Although the sopranos get all the glory, it’s the basses where everything really happens (yes, im a bass in choir). Harmonic support for the melody is everything, and changing the inversion of a chord changes its colour completely. One of the best and most well-known techniques of a good chord progression is to keep your bass line leaps minimal (a “walking” bass), and having them in a scale can have a very nice effect:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/otello6.png" alt=""> 

This naturally extends to having passing notes in the bass to keep this scale like movement constant as we traverse different chords:

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/otello7.png" alt=""> 

While this is a concept many people know, I think in practice we rarely do it, as we are more focused on the notes in our melodies. It’s nice to take care of all the voices in our chords. 

There’s a slightly more advanced technique here as well: withholding the tonic of a chord to the weak beat of the bar. This is a great example of how knowing the chords isn’t enough, we must know which beats to place them on to have the greatest effect. Here, Verdi wants to resolve the B flat 9 in the bar below to an E flat major. However, he saves the actual B flat for the second weak beat of the bar. This leads to a different, more colourful kind of resolution, as we don’t really know where we are going on the first beat of the bar. This means the move to E flat major feels more sudden and surprising. Techniques like this have to be used with discretion, however they can provide really interesting and special moments in our music.

<div class="captions">The use of suspension here is fantastic as well. So much tension</div>

<div class="header">Just Modulate</div>
Modulation is definitely an example of another technique that requires a lot of judgement on the player’s part. It is an art to modulate well, and it can take a student month’s to play a modulation that he feels satisfied with. However, here we can see Verdi’s ridiculous use of sudden modulations that just feel so <i>right</i>. He jumps from key to key freely, and it all sounds so natural.

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/otello9.png" alt=""> 

(Technically, this isn’t modulation, it's tonicisation. However, I feel like modulation is a more commonly understood term and its meaning has more or less blended together with tonicisation today. Don’t sue me.)

<div class="header">Pedal Point</div>

Lastly, I can talk about a concept that is very similar to the first. Using a pedal point can add a lot of beautiful dissonances to your music as well as allow you to use some more exotic chords, since there is always the bass to hold on to. Look at this chromatic line of chords that makes sense thanks to the E flat resolving to the A flat major in the next bar. The D-flat also helps in holding things together here with its dominant seventh colour.

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/otello10.png" alt=""> 

Verdi then took this idea to the next level near the end of the piece, where he transformed the humble arpeggio into something very special. 

<img src="https://moke8198.github.io/assets/images/otello11.png" alt=""> 

By having the A flat pedal point (which is also the tonic pedal, making it even better at tying things together) in the bass, he can use this really strange chord progression: I-IV-iii-V-I. He manipulates these chords to create the A flat major arpeggio in the first violin line, which harmonises with the tonic pedal. Hence, the progression works even though it has the awkward IV-iii progression which would make most theory teachers very uncomfortable indeed. I outright steal this progression often when I improvise. If Brahms could be inspired by Beethoven, I think I should be allowed a helping hand from Verdi.

<div class="header">V-I</div>

Practice is of course important to every musician, but I’d argue that learning to improvise and developing our harmonic language is also important for us. The skill of improvisation is as difficult as the skill of performance, and both require practice to perfect. I’d encourage more musicians to take improvisation seriously, and for me it is one of the most gratifying skills to learn in my music journey. At the end of the day, let’s have fun making music.
