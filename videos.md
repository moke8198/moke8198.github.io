  <td> One of my favourite Mozart works. I only recently discovered the origin of the famous <i>Laudate Dominum</i>, the fifth movement here. My favourite movement is actually the last, the joyful <i>Magnificat</i>, where Mozart uses the perfect fifth interval and a <i>subito piano</i> marking to great effect. The recording here is rather historically accurate, which I think is appropriate for this work where the style of writing does not call for a big choir or orchestra.

  <td> The greatest concerto ever written. The violin is my favourite instrument, its timbre is so expressive and close to the human soul. I only wish the piano could produce such a singing and sustained tone. Even when it is in its lively third movement, the tragedy of the two movements before still haunts me. Is there another composer who could express sorrow as vividly as Brahms?
