  <td> One of my favourite Mozart works. I only recently discovered the origin of the famous <i>Laudate Dominum</i>, the fifth movement here. My favourite movement is actually the last, the joyful <i>Magnificat</i>, where Mozart uses the perfect fifth interval and a <i>subito piano</i> marking to great effect. The recording here is rather historically accurate, which I think is appropriate for this work where the style of writing does not call for a big choir or orchestra.

  <td> The greatest concerto ever written. The violin is my favourite instrument, its timbre is so expressive and close to the human soul. I only wish the piano could produce such a singing and sustained tone. Even when it is in its lively third movement, the tragedy of the two movements before still haunts me. Is there another composer who could express sorrow as vividly as Brahms?

  <td> The tragic opening to the great St Matthew's Passion. This work, which details the death of Christ, opens with some of the most innovative uses of a double choir in the repetoire. The two choirs represent the disciples of Jesus, and the everyday man, calling to each other. An example of this is where on the final cadence of this section the words <i>Seht — Wohin? — auf unsre Schuld</i>, or "Look? — Where? — To our guilt" are heard. The choral dialogue begins around 3:05 in this recording.
